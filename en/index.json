Overall there have been six editions, and this latest one will make seven. It remains a useful and respected overview of the specialty. Where appropriate, changes such as adding color and, in this seventh edition, videos, have been made. The first six editions have sold 207,865 books and have been translated into many languages. A faculty member of a prestigious Department of Ophthalmology in the United States who has life certification from the American Board of Ophthalmology decided to go through Maintenance of Certification (MOC). He told me that his only preparation was to read The Wills Eye Manual from cover to cover. Today some comment that young people do not get as well rounded an education as 50 years ago. I personally believe that today’s young people are as capable and smart as any previous generation. The residents who have worked on The Wills Eye Manual quickly grasp the essentials of their subjects, and express the information comprehensively and concisely. And they meet their deadlines! It has been my privilege to have advised the residents at Wills Eye for many years, and I congratulate and salute all of the editors and their fellow residents who have made The Wills Eye Manual such a smashing success.

This edition arises from the foundation laid by all preceding contributors and, as in years past, would not have been possible without the collaborative efforts, teamwork, and never-satisfied mentality of the Wills Eye residents, fellows, and faculty. Our hope is for readers to find within this text the most up-to-date information and collective clinical recommendations regarding the office and emergency room evaluation, diagnosis, management, and treatment of ophthalmic disease. The Seventh Edition includes the results of major clinical trials since the last edition. Changing trends in the workup, categorization, and treatment of various ophthalmic specialties including trauma, oculoplastics, cornea, pediatrics, neuro-ophthalmology, uveitis, and retinal disease are reflected in this current edition. We are also proud to announce the addition of the first extensive multimedia component of The Wills Eye Manual, including an electronic database of various clinical conditions as well as office and emergency room procedures.

Copious but gentle irrigation using saline or Ringer lactate solution. Tap water can be used in the absence of these solutions and may be more efficacious in inhibiting elevated intracameral pH than normal saline for alkali burns. NEVER use acidic solutions to neutralize alkalis or vice versa as acid–base reactions themselves can generate harmful substrates and cause secondary thermal injuries. An eyelid speculum and topical anesthetic (e.g., proparacaine) may be placed prior to irrigation. Upper and lower fornices must be everted and irrigated. After exclusion of open globe injury, particulate matter should be flushed or manually removed. Manual use of intravenous tubing connected to an irrigation solution best facilitates the irrigation process. \\2. Wait 5 to 10 minutes after irrigation is stopped to allow the dilutant to be absorbed; then check the pH in the fornices using litmus paper. Irrigation is continued until neutral pH is achieved (i.e., 7.0 to 7.4). NOTE: The volume of irrigation fluid required to reach neutral pH varies with the chemical and with the duration of the chemical exposure. The volume required may range from a few liters to many liters (over 8 to 10 L). \\3. Conjunctival fornices should be swept with a moistened cotton-tipped applicator to remove any sequestered particles of caustic material and necrotic conjunctiva, especially in the case of a persistently abnormal pH. Double eversion of the eyelids with Desmarres eyelid retractors is especially important in identifying and removing particles in the deep fornix. Calcium hydroxide particles may be more easily removed with a cotton-tipped applicator soaked in disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. \\4.

Consider hospitalization for noncompliant patients, patients with bleeding diathesis or blood dyscrasia, patients with other severe ocular or orbital injuries, and patients with concomitant significant IOP elevation and sickle cell trait or disease. In addition, consider hospitalization and aggressive treatment for children, especially those at risk for amblyopia (e.g., those under age 7 to 10), when a thorough clinical examination is difficult, or when child abuse is suspected. \\1. Confine either to bed rest with bathroom privileges or to limited activity. Elevate the head of bed to allow blood to settle. Discourage strenuous activity, bending, or heavy lifting. \\2. Place a rigid shield (metal or clear plastic) over the involved eye at all times. Do not patch because this prevents recognition of sudden visual change in the event of a rebleed. \\3. Cycloplege the affected eye (e.g., cyclopentolate 1% or 2% b.i.d. to t.i.d., homatropine 5% b.i.d. to t.i.d., or atropine 1% daily to b.i.d.). \\4. Avoid antiplatelet/anticoagulant medications (i.e., aspirin-containing products and NSAIDs) unless otherwise medically necessary. Do not abruptly stop daily aspirin regimen without consulting with prescribing physicians regarding the need for anticoagulant therapy. \\5. Mild analgesics only (e.g., acetaminophen). Avoid sedatives. \\6. Use topical steroids (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% q.i.d. to q1h) if any suggestion of iritis (e.g., photophobia, deep ache, ciliary flush), evidence of lens capsule rupture, any protein (e.g., fibrin), or definitive WBCs in AC. Taper the frequency of steroids quickly as soon as signs and symptoms resolve to reduce the likelihood of steroid-induced glaucoma. NOTE: No definitive evidence exists regarding the use of steroids in improving outcomes for hyphemas. Use must be balanced with the risks of topical steroids (increased infection potential, increased IOP, cataract). In children, particular caution must be used regarding topical steroids. Children often get rapid rises in IOP, and with prolonged use there is a significant risk for cataract. As outlined above, in certain cases steroids may be beneficial, but steroids should be prescribed in an individualized manner. Children must be monitored closely for increased IOP and should be tapered off the steroids as soon as possible. \\7. For increased IOP: NOTE: Increased IOP, especially soon after trauma, may be transient, secondary to acute mechanical plugging of the trabecular meshwork. Elevating the patient’s head may decrease the IOP by causing RBCs to settle inferiorly and clot. • Nonsickle cell disease or trait (≥30 mm Hg): • Start with a beta-blocker (e.g., timolol or levobunolol 0.5% b.i.d.). • If IOP is still high, add topical alpha-agonist (e.g., apraclonidine 0.5% or brimonidine 0.1% or 0.2% t.i.d.) or topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., dorzolamide 2% or brinzolamide 1% t.i.d.). Avoid prostaglandin analogs and miotics (may increase inflammation). In children under age 2, topical alpha-agonists are contraindicated. • If topical therapy fails, add acetazolamide (up to 500 mg p.o. q12h for adults, 20 mg/kg/day divided three times per day for children) or mannitol (1 to 2 g/kg i.v. over 45 minutes q24h). If mannitol is necessary to control the IOP, surgical evacuation may be imminent. • Sickle cell disease or trait (≥24 mm Hg): • Start with a beta-blocker (e.g., timolol or levobunolol 0.5% b.i.d.). • All other agents must be used with extreme caution: Topical dorzolamide and brinzolamide may reduce aqueous pH and induce increased sickling; topical alpha-agonists (e.g., brimonidine or apraclonidine) may affect iris vasculature; miotics and prostaglandins may promote inflammation. • If possible, avoid systemic diuretics because they promote sickling by inducing systemic acidosis and vo","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/the_wills_eye/:134:0","tags":["eye"],"title":"The Wills Eye Manual","uri":"/en/the_wills_eye/"},{"categories":["eye"],"content":"Follow-Up \\1. The patient should be seen daily after initial trauma to check visual acuity, IOP, and for a slit lamp examination. Look for new bleeding (most commonly occurs within the first 5 to 10 days), increased IOP, corneal blood staining, and other intraocular injuries as the blood clears (e.g., iridodialysis; subluxated or dislocated lens, or cataract). Hemolysis, which may appear as bright red fluid, should be distinguished from a rebleed, which forms a new, bright red clot. If the IOP is increased, treat as described earlier. Time between visits may be increased once consistent improvement in clinical examination is documented. \\2. The patient should be instructed to return immediately if a sudden increase in pain or decrease in vision is noted (which may be symptoms of a rebleed or increased IOP). \\3. If a significant rebleed or an intractable IOP increase occurs, hospitalization or surgical evacuation may be considered. \\4. After the initial close follow-up period, the patient may be maintained on a long-acting cycloplegic agent (e.g., atropine 1% daily to b.i.d.) depending on the severity of the condition. Topical steroids may be tapered as the blood, fibrin, and WBCs resolve. \\5. Glasses or eye shield during the day and eye shield at night. As with any patient, protective eyewear (polycarbonate shatterproof lenses) should be worn any time potential for an eye injury exists. \\6. The patient must refrain from strenuous physical activities (including bearing down or Valsalva maneuvers) for at least 1 week after the initial injury or rebleed. Normal activities may be resumed once the hyphema has resolved and patient is out of rebleed time frame. \\7. Future outpatient follow-up: • If the patient is hospitalized, see 2 to 3 days after discharge. If not hospitalized, see several days to 1 week after initial daily follow-up period, depending on the severity of condition (amount of blood, potential for IOP increase, other ocular or orbital pathologic processes). • Four weeks after trauma for gonioscopy and dilated fundus examination with scleral depression for all patients. • Some experts suggest annual follow-up because of the potential for development of angle-recession glaucoma. • If any complications arise, more frequent follow-up is required. • If filtering surgery was performed, follow-up and activity restrictions are based on the surgeon’s specific recommendations.

Carefully evert the eyelids and use toothed forceps or cotton-tipped applicators to gently pull open one edge of the wound to determine the depth of penetration. (If foreign body suspected, get imaging described below before extensive wound exploration.) \\4. CT scan of brain, orbits, and midface (axial, coronal, and parasagittal views, 1- to 2-mm sections) should be obtained with any history suggestive of penetrating injury or severe blunt trauma to rule out fracture, retained foreign body, ruptured globe, or intracranial injury. If there is any suspicion of deeper injury, obtain imaging before eyelid laceration repair. Loss of consciousness usually mandates a CT scan of the brain. Depending on the mechanism of injury, the cervical spine may need to be cleared. \\5. If laceration is nasal to the punctum, even if not obviously through the canalicular system, perform punctal dilation and probing with possible irrigation of the canalicular system to exclude canalicular involvement (see Figures 3.8.2 and 3.8.3 ; APPENDIX 7, TECHNIQUE FOR DIAGNOSTIC PROBING AND IRRIGATION OF THE LACRIMAL SYSTEM). \\6. Be suspicious in glancing blunt trauma to the lateral cheek (zygoma). A lateral glancing mechanism may abruptly stretch the medial canthal anatomy, resulting in avulsion of the medial canthal tendon with concomitant canalicular laceration. Canalicular lacerations are often missed with this mechanism because clinical attention is directed laterally to the zygoma and the medial canthal soft tissues often reappose into a normal position, camouflaging the extent of the injury.

For human or animal bites, consider penicillin V. If indicated, consider rabies prophylaxis. NOTE: In most states, animal bites must be reported to the local Department of Health. \\3. Repair eyelid laceration 3A. Determine appropriate setting for repair. The following findings are an indication for repair in the operating room: • Association with ocular or deep adnexal trauma that requires surgery (e.g., ruptured globe or intraorbital foreign body). • Involvement of the lacrimal drainage apparatus except when uncomplicated and close to the punctum in a cooperative patient. Note that repair of canalicular lacerations is not an ophthalmic emergency. Repair can be delayed up to 4 days with no negative effects. • Involvement of the levator aponeurosis of the upper eyelid or the superior rectus muscle. • Visible orbital fat in an eyelid laceration, indicating penetration of the orbital septum. All such patients require CT imaging and careful documentation of levator and extraocular muscle function. Exploration of deeper tissue planes may be necessary. • Medial canthal tendon avulsion (exhibits displacement, excessive rounding, or abnormal laxity of the medial canthus). • Extensive tissue loss (especially more than one-third of the eyelid) or severe distortion of anatomy. 3B. Procedure for eyelid laceration repair in the minor surgery room: NOTE: Eye protection should be worn by all healthcare providers. • Place a drop of topical anesthetic in each eye. Place a protective scleral shell over the affected eye, and cover the uninvolved eye with a moistened, folded gauze sponge. Clean the area of injury and the surrounding skin with copious irrigation and full-strength povidone–iodine solution (avoid povidone soap because this irritates the cornea). Isolate the area with surgical drapes. NOTE: Lacerations from human or animal bites or those with significant risk of contamination may require minimal debridement of necrotic tissue. Because of the excellent blood supply to the lids, primary repair is usually performed. Alternatively, contaminated wounds may be left open for delayed repair. For primary repair, proceed to the subsequent steps. • Administer local subcutaneous anesthetic (e.g., 2% lidocaine with epinephrine). Place a scleral shell for protection of the globe. Since direct injection of local anesthetic causes tissue distortion and bleeding, use the minimal amount of anesthetic needed or perform field blocks (e.g., supraorbital, infraorbital, and/or anterior ethmoidal nerve blocks). • If foreign bodies are encountered unexpectedly and appear to penetrate the globe or orbital tissues, do NOT remove. Involvement of the orbit, cavernous sinus, or brain requires an extensive preoperative evaluation and a multidisciplinary approach (e.g., otolaryngology or neurosurgery) and ancillary testing (e.g., angiography). • Close the laceration as follows: ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/the_wills_eye/:157:0","tags":["eye"],"title":"The Wills Eye Manual","uri":"/en/the_wills_eye/"},{"categories":["eye"],"content":"Non-Marginal Eyelid Laceration SEE BULLETS ABOVE. Then close the skin with interrupted 6-0 absorbable (e.g., plain gut, chromic gut) sutures.

Nonabsorbable sutures should be avoided in patients who may not follow up compliantly. Avoid deep sutures within the confines of the orbital rim and never suture the orbital septum.

The most important step is reapproximation of the tarsus along its vertical axis to allow for proper eyelid alignment and healing. Reapproximation of the tarsus at the margin alone will not provide structural integrity to the eyelid; the injured tarsus will splay apart, resulting in eyelid notching (See Figure 3.8.4C ). • Be careful to avoid deeper, buried subcutaneous sutures that can incorporate the orbital septum, resulting in eyelid tethering. In general, deep sutures should be avoided in the zone between the tarsus and orbital rim (the vertical lengths of the upper and lower tarsi are approximately 10 mm and 5 mm, respectively). Figure 3.8.4. Marginal eyelid laceration repair, traditional method. A: Reapproximate the gray line with a 6-0 silk suture. B: The most important step is to realign the tarsal edges with multiple interrupted 5-0 or 6-0 absorbable (e.g., Vicryl) sutures. Take partial-thickness bites. C: Failure to realign the tarsus will compromise the integrity of the eyelid, resulting in splaying and notching. D: Tie the tarsal and gray line sutures. E: Place another marginal 6-0 silk suture. F: Suture the skin with interrupted 6-0 plain gut, securing the tails of the marginal sutures. • Deep tarsal sutures should be lamellar (partial thickness), especially in the upper eyelid, to avoid penetration through the underlying conjunctiva and subsequent corneal irritation/injury. NOTE: If patient reliability is questionable, use absorbable (e.g., 6-0 Vicryl) sutures for every step. • If unsure about patient reliability or in patients who will not cooperate for suture removal (e.g., young children, patients with advanced dementia, etc.), use absorbable 6-0 polyglactin suture (e.g., Vicryl) in the eyelid margin instead of nonabsorbable material (e.g., silk). ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/the_wills_eye/:160:0","tags":["eye"],"title":"The Wills Eye Manual","uri":"/en/the_wills_eye/"},{"categories":["eye"],"content":"Procedure Steps (See Figure 3.8.4 .) a. Place a 6-0 silk suture from gray line to gray line, entering and exiting the gray line 2 mm from the laceration edge. (As already noted, in difficult or unreliable patients, use absorbable suture material only.) Put the suture on traction with a hemostat to ensure good reapproximation of the splayed tarsus and gray line. Leave the suture untied. NOTE: This marginal suture provides no structural integrity to the eyelid; its main function is to align the eyelid margin anatomy to ensure a good cosmetic repair. b. Realign the tarsal edges with multiple interrupted sutures placed through an anterior approach (e.g., 5-0 or 6-0 polyglactin on a spatulated needle). This is the most important structural step in marginal laceration closure. In the upper eyelid, three sutures can usually be placed. In the lower eyelid, two sutures are typically the maximum. A single tarsal suture is inadequate for appropriate tarsal realignment. Failure to reapproximate the tarsus along its entire vertical length will result in eyelid splaying and notching. c. Tie down and trim the tarsal sutures. Tie down the marginal silk suture leaving long tails. d. Place and tie another 6-0 silk marginal suture either anterior or posterior to the gray-line suture, again leaving long tails. The posterior suture is often unnecessary and its absence may decrease the risk of postoperative corneal abrasion. When placing marginal sutures, attempt to realign the normal eyelid anatomy (lash line, meibomian glands, gray line). e. Use interrupted 6-0 plain gut sutures to close the skin along the length of the laceration. Incorporate the tails of all eyelid margin sutures into the skin suture closest to the eyelid margin to keep tails away from the corneal surface. f. Final steps • Remove the protective eye shell. • Apply antibiotic ointment (e.g., bacitracin or erythromycin ophthalmic) to the wound t.i.d. • Dress the wound if needed and consider oral antibiotics if needed. For lacerations beyond the orbital rim where deeper dermis is encountered, it is prudent to apply a topical adhesive (benzoin or Mastisol) and Steri-Strips perpendicular to the axis of the laceration to reinforce the sutures and decrease tension on the skin. Antibiotic ointment is applied once the strips have been placed.

Complete ophthalmic examination, including visual acuity, measurement of extraocular movement, IOP, and globe displacement. Check pupils and color vision to rule out a TON (SEE 3.11, TRAUMATIC OPTIC NEUROPATHY ). Compare the sensation of the affected cheek with that on the contralateral side; palpate the eyelids for crepitus (subcutaneous emphysema); palpate the orbital rim for step-off deformities. Evaluate the globe carefully for an apparent or occult rupture, hyphema or microhyphema, traumatic iritis, and retinal or choroidal damage. A full, dilated examination may be difficult in uncooperative patients with periocular edema, but is extremely important in the management of orbital fractures. If eyelid and periocular edema limit the view, special techniques may be necessary (e.g., use of Desmarres retractors or clean paperclips [See Figure 3.9.1 ], lateral cantholysis, examination under general anesthesia). NOTE: It is of paramount importance to rule out intraocular and optic nerve injury as quickly as possible in ALL patients presenting with suspected orbital fracture. NOTE: Pediatric patients are particularly at risk for a unique type of blowout injury: the “trapdoor” fracture. Because pediatric bones lack complete calcification, they tend to “greenstick” rather than completely fracture. This results in an initial fracture, herniation of orbital soft tissue (including EOM) through the fracture site, and a rapid snapping back of the malleable bone akin to a trapdoor on a spring. Because of the tight reapposition of the fracture edges, the soft tissue trapped within the fracture becomes ischemic. Children with this type of fracture often have a remarkably benign external periocular appearance, but significant extraocular muscle restriction (usually vertical) on examination; this constellation of findings has been dubbed the “white-eyed blowout fracture” (WEBOF). Children may present with a vague history, allow only a limited ocular exam, and be misdiagnosed as having an intracranial injury (e.g., concussion) leading to delay in management of WEBOF. Be aware of the oculocardiac reflex (nausea or vomiting, bradycardia, syncope, dehydration) that can accompany entrapment. Even in cases where correct orbital imaging is performed, CT evidence of an orbital fracture may be minimal and routinely missed. Careful examination of coronal and parasagittal views is critical in such cases. (J Oral Maxillofac Surg 2009;67(5):986–989). In typical (i.e., non-WEBOF) orbital fractures, forced duction testing may be performed if limitation of eye movement persists beyond 1 week and restriction is suspected. That said, in the early phase it is often difficult to distinguish soft tissue edema or contusion from soft tissue entrapment in the fracture.

CT of the orbit and midface (axial, coronal, and parasagittal views, 1- to 1.5-mm sections, without contrast) is obtained in all cases of suspected orbital fractures. Bone windows are especially helpful in the evaluation of fractures (see Figures 3.9.2 and 3.9.3 ), including the narrow, oft-missed WEBOF. Inclusion of the midfacial skeleton is also recommended in such cases to rule out zygomatic complex or Le Fort fractures. If there is any history of loss of consciousness, brain imaging is recommended. Figure 3.9.2. CT of orbital blowout fracture. Figure 3.9.3.

CT orbit (axial, coronal, and parasagittal views). When vision and/or optic nerve function is threatened, CT should always be delayed until definitive treatment with canthotomy/cantholysis. CT rarely shows a discreet hematoma. Typically, retrobulbar hemorrhage manifests as a diffuse, increased reticular pattern of the intraconal orbital fat. The so-called “teardrop” or “tenting” sign may be seen: the optic nerve is at maximum stretch and distorts (tents) the back of the globe into a teardrop shape. This is an ominous radiologic sign, especially if the posterior scleral angle is \u003c130 degrees. The presence of an orbital fracture may help to decompress the orbit and decrease, but not rule out, the possibility of OCS. It is important to remember that patients can still develop OCS and optic neuropathy even with large orbital fractures, as blood may simply fill the adjacent paranasal sinus and then cause an OCS. NOTE: Retrobulbar hemorrhage with OCS is a clinical diagnosis and does not require imaging. A delay while CT is being obtained may cause further visual compromise.

The initial goal is to decrease the compression on critical soft tissues, mainly the optic nerve. All patients should be treated utilizing the same guidelines, even if the hemorrhage is thought to have occurred hours or days ago, since it is often impossible to know at what point along the clinical timeline optic neuropathy manifested. \\1. If optic neuropathy is present, immediately release orbital pressure with lateral canthotomy and inferior cantholysis (See Figure 3.10.2 below). The procedure can be performed in an office or ER setting with basic instrumentation and local anesthetic injection if possible. Conscious sedation can be used in the ER setting if this does not delay treatment, but is usually unnecessary. Figure 3.10.2. Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis. A: Lateral canthotomy.

If there are no orbital signs and no evidence of ocular ischemia or compressive optic neuropathy but the IOP is increased (e.g., ≥35 mm Hg in a patient with a normal optic nerve, or ≥20 mm Hg in a patient with glaucoma who normally has a lower IOP), the patient is treated in a more stepwise fashion in an effort to reduce the IOP (SEE BELOW AND 9.1, PRIMARY OPEN ANGLE GLAUCOMA).

The goal of canthotomy and cantholysis is to perform an adequate soft tissue decompression of the orbit by disinserting the lower eyelid from its periosteal attachments. A nonperfused retina infarcts irreversibly in approximately 90 minutes, and a delay of definitive treatment of longer duration may lead to retinal nerve fiber death and permanent vision loss. NOTE: A canthotomy alone is inadequate treatment. A cantholysis must be performed. a. Consider subdermal injection of lidocaine 2% with epinephrine (inject away from the eye). Because of the eyelid edema and acidotic local environment, local anesthesia may not be effective. A field block may be used. The patient should be warned that the procedure may be painful, but fortunately in most cases canthotomy and cantholysis can be performed quickly. b. Consider placing a hemostat horizontally at the lateral canthus and clamp for 1 minute to compress the tissue and reduce bleeding (an optional step that should not be performed without good local anesthesia). c. Only two instruments are needed for canthotomy and cantholysis: A pair of blunt-tipped scissors (e.g., Westcott or Stevens) and forceps with heavy teeth (e.g., Bishop Harmon or Adson). Avoid sharp-tipped scissors to minimize the chance of globe injury. Delicate forceps (e.g., 0.12-mm Castroviejo) will not provide enough traction to effectively disinsert the eyelid and should not be used. d. Perform the canthotomy. Place the scissors across the lateral canthus and incise the canthus for about 1-cm full thickness (from conjunctiva to skin). Forceps are not needed for this step. This step simply gains access to the inferior crux of the lateral canthal tendon. It provides very little soft tissue decompression. e. Perform inferior cantholysis. With the toothed forceps, grasp the lower eyelid at the inner edge of the incised canthus. With the patient supine, traction should be directed upward, toward the ceiling. Place the scissors in an open position just beneath the skin, with the tips pointing toward the tip of the nose, and begin to cut. Some advocate “strumming” of the lateral canthal tendon, but this is not essential and sometimes difficult to assess because of tissue edema. As the canthal tendon is released, the eyelid should come completely away from the globe. NOTE: The cantholysis is critical to decompress the orbit, and is done exclusively by feel. Do not visually search for a specific tendon or anatomic landmark. f. There are several clues to a successful cantholysis. The eyelid should release completely away from the globe. Once the forceps are released, the lateral portion of the eyelid margin should move medially, usually to the lateral aspect of the limbus of the globe. If any eyelid margin still remains in its normal position lateral to the temporal limbus, the cantholysis is incomplete: keep cutting! g. Because of the eyelid edema, the incision will bleed. Cautery is usually unnecessary. Pressure over the bone of the lateral orbital rim (but not on the globe and orbit) for several minutes usually results in good control. However, with the widespread use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications (e.g., warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel) as well as increasing prescription of irreversible anticoagulants (e.g., rivaroxaban, dabigatran, etc.), excessive bleeding can be encountered. In these cases, manual pressure is often inadequate and applying hemostatic aids (e.g., biologic agents such as thrombin and fibrinogen or physical agents such as gelatin, collagen, cellulose) may be necessary. Cautery is effective if available. h. The results of a successful cantholysis are usually evident within the first 15 minutes. IOP should decrease and the retina should reperfuse. Cadaver studies have shown a reliable correlation between IOP and intraorbital pressure. A significant decrease in IOP after cantholysis is indicative of a successful orbital soft tissue decompression.","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/the_wills_eye/:173:1","tags":["eye"],"title":"The Wills Eye Manual","uri":"/en/the_wills_eye/"},{"categories":["eye"],"content":"Follow-Up In cases where vision is threatened, monitor the patient closely until stable, with frequent vision and IOP checks. Any patient with a posttraumatic orbital hemorrhage older than 6 to 8 hours with normal visual function should be instructed in detail on how to serially measure visual function, especially over the first 24 hours, and to return immediately if vision deteriorates. Cantholysis wounds may be left open with application of antibiotic ointment t.i.d. to spontaneously heal, or closed with a secondary canthoplasty 1 to 3 weeks later. If reconstruction of the lateral canthus is indicated, it may be performed as an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia. The inferior canthal tendon is sutured back to the inner aspect of the lateral orbital rim. Interestingly, a significant percentage of eyelids will heal adequately without any surgery. If a residual optic neuropathy is present, the patient should be followed with serial examinations and visual fields.

Anterior TON is arbitrarily defined as occurring anterior to the entrance of the central retinal artery into the optic nerve. Direct TON is usually due to compression, contusion, and/or laceration of the optic nerve. Indirect TON is typically due to deceleration injury with shearing of the nerve and vascular supply in the optic canal and less commonly due to rapid rotation of the globe leading to optic nerve head avulsion. • Compressive optic neuropathy from orbital hemorrhage: Most common TON. (SEE 3.10, TRAUMATIC RETROBULBAR HEMORRHAGE.) • Compressive optic neuropathy from orbital foreign body: A subcategory of direct TON. (SEE 3.12, INTRAORBITAL FOREIGN BODY.) • Bony impingement: A posterior direct TON that results from impingement of the apical optic nerve from a fracture at the orbital apex. Mechanisms vary widely. Direct bony impingement on the optic canal may result from a skull base fracture of any structure, including the cavernous sinus, with resultant cranial neuropathy (See Figure 3.11.1 ). Figure 3.11.1. CT of bony impingement of the optic nerve. • Optic nerve sheath hematoma: An extremely rare and difficult to diagnose direct or indirect TON. Imaging may show perineural blood in the optic nerve sheath. Often a presumptive diagnosis requiring an abnormal fundus appearance, typically a combination of retinal venous and arterial occlusions (e.g., central retinal artery occlusion, central retinal vein occlusion). Progressive visual loss may occur as the hematoma expands. In most cases, optic nerve sheath hematoma is seen in conjunction with retinal hemorrhages and a subarachnoid intracranial bleed (Terson syndrome). • Deceleration injury: The second most common form of TON, specifically known as posterior indirect TON, but often simply referred to as TON. The skull (usually the forehead, but can be the midface) hits a static object (e.g., steering wheel, handlebars, pavement) while the soft tissue within the orbit continues to move forward. Since the optic nerve is tethered at the optic canal, shearing of the nutrient pial vessels may occur with subsequent optic nerve edema within the confined space of the optic canal. A second “shock wave” mechanism may also occur. Cadaver studies have shown that a blow to the frontal bone is transmitted to the optic canal. Visual loss from posterior indirect TON is typically immediate and progresses in less than 10% of cases. • Others (e.g., optic nerve laceration, prechiasmal optic nerve avulsion).

Complete ocular examination including an assessment of visual acuity and pupils. This may be difficult depending on the patient’s mental status, use of sedatives, narcotics, and so forth. NOTE: If a bilateral, symmetric TON is present, an RAPD may be absent. In addition, if an RAPD is present, the patient may have either a unilateral TON or a bilateral asymmetric TON. Do not assume that vision is not compromised in the fellow eye, especially in comatose or sedated patients. \\3. Color vision testing in each eye. Checking red desaturation is a useful alternative if color plates are not available. \\4. Visual fields by confrontation. Formal visual field testing is helpful if available. \\5. CT scan of the head and orbit (axial, coronal, and parasagittal views) with thin (i.e., 1 mm) sections through the optic canal and skull base to rule out an intraorbital foreign body or bony impingement on the optic nerve. There may be fractures along the cribriform plate, the sphenoid sinus, and the medial wall of the cavernous sinus. A normal CT in no way rules out posterior indirect TON. Similarly, an optic canal fracture does not mean TON is present. \\6. B-scan ultrasound if optic nerve head avulsion is suspected but is obscured clinically by a hyphema, VH, or other media opacity.

Optic nerve laceration: No effective treatment. \\5. Optic nerve head avulsion: No effective treatment. \\6. Deceleration injury: Effective treatment of posterior indirect TON is, at best, extremely limited. Given the results of the CRASH study, high-dose corticosteroids should never be offered by ophthalmologists to patients with concomitant TBI or if the TON is older than 8 hours. In the vast majority of cases, we recommend observation alone. If corticosteroids are considered (no evidence of TBI, injury within 8-hour window, no medical comorbidities), the lack of definitive therapeutic evidence and significant side effects must be discussed with the patient and/or family and the primary team; as a practical matter, this scenario is not frequently encountered. Dosing of methylprednisolone includes a loading dose of 30 mg/kg and then 5.4 mg/kg q6h for 48 hours. Histamine type 2 receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine) or proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) should be given concomitantly. \\7. Bone impingement of the optic canal: Endoscopic optic canal and orbital apex decompression may be offered in select cases, especially if the optic neuropathy is progressive. However, this option should be approached with extreme caution because of the proximity to the cavernous sinus and carotid siphon and possible bony instability of the skull base. The procedure should only be performed by an otolaryngologist experienced in stereotactic endoscopic sinus and skull base surgery. The patient and/or family should also be informed that there is no definitive data that proves efficacy of this procedure in TON and that optic canal decompression may result in additional damage to the intracanalicular optic nerve.

With a nonprogressive TON, the patient can follow up in weeks to months to assess for spontaneous improvement. If a secondary etiology is causing a TON, follow-up depends on the intervention offered and may be more frequent and prolonged. If facial and orbital fracture repair is indicated, it is crucial to document the preoperative visual acuity and visual fields (if possible), and to explain to the patient and family that TON is present in order to avoid later claims of iatrogenic optic nerve injury. In comatose patients with suspected TON who require facial or orbital fracture repair, the family should be informed that only limited assessment of visual function is possible preoperatively, but significant traumatic visual compromise may have occurred. Always remember that an RAPD may indicate asymmetric, bilateral TON; resist any reassurances to the patient’s family of normal contralateral visual function in obtunded or uncooperative patients with an RAPD. Anecdotally, mild-to-moderate posterior indirect TON may show significant spontaneous improvement over 3 to 6 months in 30% to 60% of patients, while severe initial visual loss seems to carry a worse prognosis.

NEVER remove an intraorbital foreign body at the slit lamp without first obtaining imaging to evaluate the depth and direction of penetration. Premature removal may result in intracranial bleeding, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, worsening of intraocular injury, and so forth. Figure 3.12.3. Axial and coronal CT of an orbital wooden foreign body, read initially as orbital emphysema. Note the squared-off scleral edge (arrow) on the axial image and the “stag horn” appearance (arrow) on the coronal image, both suggestive of retained orbital wood. \\2. Surgical exploration, irrigation, and extraction, based on the following indications: • Signs of infection or inflammation (e.g., fever, proptosis, restricted motility, severe chemosis, a palpable orbital mass, abscess on CT scan). • Any organic or wooden foreign body (because of the high risk for infection and sight-threatening complications). Many copper foreign bodies need to be removed because of a marked inflammatory reaction. • Infectious fistula formation. • Signs of optic nerve compression or gaze-evoked amaurosis (decreased vision in a specific gaze). • A large or sharp-edged foreign body (independent of composition) that can be easily extracted. • Removal of an orbital foreign body should never be attempted in the setting of a ruptured globe. The globe must be repaired first. The orbital foreign body may be removed as necessary thereafter. NOTE: Posteriorly located foreign bodies are often simply observed if inert and not causing optic nerve compression because of the risk of iatrogenic optic neuropathy or diplopia if surgical removal is attempted. Alternatively, even an inert and otherwise asymptomatic metallic foreign body that is anterior and easily accessed may be removed with relatively low morbidity. \\3. Tetanus toxoid as indicated (SEE APPENDIX 2, TETANUS PROPHYLAXIS). \\4. Consider hospitalization. • Administer systemic antibiotics promptly (e.g., cefazolin, 1 g i.v. q8h, for clean, inert objects). If the object is contaminated or organic, treat as orbital cellulitis (SEE 7.3.1, ORBITAL CELLULITIS). • Follow vision, degree (if any) of afferent pupillary defect, extraocular motility, proptosis, and eye discomfort daily. • Surgical exploration and removal of the foreign body when indicated (as above). Warn the patient and the family preoperatively that it may be impossible to find and remove the foreign body. Wood is notorious for splintering on entry, and multiple procedures may be necessary to entirely remove it. Organic foreign bodies frequently cause recurrent or smoldering infection within the orbit, which may require months of antibiotic therapy and additional surgical exploration. This may result in progressive orbital soft tissue fibrosis and restrictive strabismus. • If the decision is made to leave the orbital foreign body in place, discharge when stable with oral antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin–clavulanate 250/125 to 500/125 mg p.o. q8h or 875/125 mg p.o. b.i.d.) to complete a 10- to 14-day course. \\5.

Examine closely for possible entry sites (rule out self-sealing lacerations), pupil irregularities, iris tears and TIDs, capsular perforations, lens opacities, hyphema, AC shallowing (or deepening in scleral perforations), and asymmetrically low IOP in the involved eye. Assess for any damage to the lacrimal apparatus. \\6. Dilate the eye and examine the posterior segment for a possible IOFB unless there is risk of extrusion of intraocular contents (SEE 3.15, INTRAOCULAR FOREIGN BODY ). \\7. Consider a B-scan ultrasonography, a CT scan of the orbit (axial, coronal, and parasagittal views, 1-mm sections), or UBM to exclude an intraocular or intraorbital foreign body. Avoid MRI if history concerning for possible metallic foreign body.

Contact lens wear is another risk factor. Infiltrates commonly have feathery borders and may be surrounded by satellite lesions. Candida infections generally occur in eyes with pre-existing ocular surface disease and may mimic the clinical picture of bacterial ulcers. SEE 4.12, FUNGAL KERATITIS . • Acanthamoeba: This protozoan classically causes an extremely painful keratitis and/or stromal infiltrate; is associated with perineural invasion. It usually occurs in daily-wear soft contact lens wearers who may or may not practice poor lens hygiene. History of trauma or history of swimming and/or hot tubbing while wearing contact lenses may be elicited. In the early stages, the epithelial abnormality may look more like HSV keratitis than a bacterial ulcer. In the late stages (3 to 8 weeks), the infiltrate often becomes ring shaped. SEE 4.13, ACANTHAMOEBA KERATITIS . • HSV: May have eyelid vesicles or corneal epithelial dendrites. A history of recurrent unilateral eye disease or known ocular herpes is common. If a staining infiltrate develops in a patient with stromal herpetic keratitis, one needs to rule out bacterial superinfection. SEE 4.15, HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS . • Atypical mycobacteria: Usually follows ocular injuries with vegetable matter or ocular surgery, such as cataract extraction, corneal grafts, and refractive surgery (especially LASIK). It has a more indolent course. Culture plates (on Lowenstein–Jensen media) must be kept for 8 weeks. An acid-fast bacillus smear is very helpful. • Sterile corneal thinning and ulcers: Minimal or no discharge, mild iritis, peripheral stromal infiltration with overlying staining and adjacent vascularization, and negative cultures. Corneal melting may be associated with various systemic diseases. SEE 4.22, PERIPHERAL CORNEAL THINNING/ULCERATION . • Staphylococcal hypersensitivity: Peripheral corneal infiltrates, sometimes with an overlying epithelial defect; usually multiple, often bilateral, with a clear space between the infiltrate and the limbus. Conjunctival injection is localized rather than diffuse, and there is less pain. There is minimal-to-no anterior chamber reaction. Often with coexisting blepharitis/meibomitis. SEE 4.18, STAPHYLOCOCCAL HYPERSENSITIVITY . • Sterile corneal infiltrates: Typically from an immune reaction to contact lens solutions or hypoxia related to contact lens wear. Usually multiple small, often peripheral, subepithelial infiltrates with little overlying staining and minimal anterior chamber reaction. Usually a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out an infectious process. Similar lesions can occur after adenoviral conjunctivitis, but these tend to be more central and less dense with a preceding history of conjunctivitis. SEE 5.1, ACUTE CONJUNCTIVITIS . • Residual corneal foreign body or rust ring: History of foreign body injury. May be accompanied by corneal stromal inflammation, edema, and sometimes, a sterile infiltrate. There may be a mild anterior chamber reaction. The infiltrate and inflammation usually clear after the foreign body and rust ring are removed, but a superinfection may occur. • Topical anesthetic abuse: A type of neurotrophic ulcer that should be suspected when there is poor response to appropriate therapy. In the late stages of anesthetic abuse, the corneal appearance may mimic an infectious process such as Acanthamoeba or herpes simplex stromal keratitis. A large ring opacity, edema, and anterior chamber reaction are characteristic. Crack cocaine keratopathy has a similar appearance. Healing, with or without scarring, typically occurs after the exposure to anesthetic is stopped.

In general, corneal infections are assumed to be bacterial until proven otherwise by laboratory studies or until a therapeutic trial of topical antibiotics is unsuccessful. At Wills Eye, the most common causes of bacterial keratitis are Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Moraxella, and Serratia species. Clinical findings vary widely depending on the severity of disease and on the organism involved. The following clinical characteristics may be helpful in predicting the organism involved. However, clinical impression should never take the place of broad-spectrum initial treatment and appropriate laboratory evaluation. SEE APPENDIX 8, CORNEAL CULTURE PROCEDURE. • Staphylococcal ulcers typically have a well-defined, gray-white stromal infiltrate that may enlarge to form a dense stromal abscess. • Streptococcal infiltrates may be either very purulent or crystalline (SEE 4.14, CRYSTALLINE KERATOPATHY) . Acute fulminant onset with severe anterior chamber reaction and hypopyon formation are common in the former, while the latter tends to have a more indolent course and occurs in patients often on chronic topical steroids (e.g., corneal transplant patients). • Pseudomonas typically presents as a rapidly progressive, suppurative, necrotic infiltrate associated with a hypopyon and mucopurulent discharge in the setting of soft contact lens wear (See Figure 4.11.2 ). • Moraxella may cause infectious keratitis in patients with pre-existing ocular surface disease and in patients who are immunocompromised.

This means that the patient will be placing a drop in the eye every one-half hour around the clock. Vancomycin drops should be reserved for resistant organisms, patients at risk for resistant organisms (e.g., due to hospital or antibiotic exposure, unresponsive to initial treatment), and for patients who are allergic to penicillin or cephalosporins. An increasing number of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are now community acquired. If the ulcer is severe and Pseudomonas is suspected, consider starting fortified tobramycin every 30 minutes and fortified cefazolin q1h; in addition, consider fortified ceftazidime q1h. NOTE: All patients with borderline risk of visual loss or severe vision-threatening ulcers are initially treated with loading doses of antibiotics using the following regimen: One drop every 5 minutes for five doses, then every 30 to 60 minutes around the clock. \\1. In some cases, topical corticosteroids are added after the bacterial organism and sensitivities are known, the infection is under control, and severe inflammation persists. Infectious keratitis may worsen significantly with topical corticosteroids, especially when caused by fungus, atypical mycobacteria, or Pseudomonas. \\2. Eyes with corneal thinning should be protected by a shield without a pressure patch (a patch is never placed over an eye thought to have an infection). The use of a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (e.g., doxycycline 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.) and a collagen synthesis promoter such as systemic ascorbic acid (e.g., vitamin C 1 to 2 g daily) may help to suppress connective tissue breakdown and prevent the perforation of the cornea. \\3. No contact lens wear. \\4. Oral pain medication as needed. \\5. Oral fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.; moxifloxacin 400 mg p.o. daily) penetrate the eye well. These may have added benefit for patients with scleral extension or for those with frank or impending perforation. Ciprofloxacin is preferred for Pseudomonas and Serratia. \\6. Systemic antibiotics are also necessary for Neisseria infections (e.g., ceftriaxone 1 g intravenously [i.v.] q12–24h if corneal involvement, or a single 1 g intramuscular [i.m.] dose if there is only conjunctival involvement) and for Haemophilus infections (e.g., oral amoxicillin/clavulanate [20 to 40 mg/kg/day in three divided doses]) because of occasional extraocular involvement such as otitis media, pneumonia, and meningitis. NOTE: Systemic fluoroquinolones were historically used for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but are no longer recommended to treat gonococcal infections (especially in men who have sex with men, in areas of high endemic resistance, and in patients with a recent foreign travel history) due to increased resistance. Additionally, they are contraindicated in pregnant women and children. \\7. Admission to the hospital may be necessary if: • Infection is sight threatening and/or impending perforation. • Patient has difficulty administering the antibiotics at the prescribed frequency. • High likelihood of noncompliance with drops or daily follow-up. • Suspected topical anesthetic abuse. • Intravenous antibiotics are needed (e.g., gonococcal conjunctivitis with corneal involvement). Often employed in the presence of corneal perforation and/or scleral extension of infection. • For atypical mycobacteria, consider prolonged tr","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/the_wills_eye/:308:3","tags":["eye"],"title":"The Wills Eye Manual","uri":"/en/the_wills_eye/"},{"categories":["eye"],"content":"Follow-Up \\1. Daily evaluation at first, including repeat measurements of the size of the infiltrate and epithelial defect. The most important criteria in evaluating treatment response are the amount of pain, the epithelial defect size (which may initially increase because of scraping for cultures and smears), the size and depth of the infiltrate, and the anterior chamber reaction. The IOP must be checked and treated if elevated (SEE 9.7, INFLAMMATORY OPEN ANGLE GLAUCOMA) . Reduced pain is often the first sign of a positive response to treatment. \\2. If improving, the antibiotic regimen is gradually tapered but is never tapered past the minimum dose to inhibit the emergence of resistance (usually t.i.d. to q.i.d. depending on the agent). Otherwise, the antibiotic regimen is adjusted according to the culture and sensitivity results. \\3. Consider new or repeat cultures and stains (without stopping treatment) in the setting of non-responsive or worsening infiltrate/ulcer. Treat with fortified antibiotics and modify based on culture results and the clinical course. Hospitalization may be recommended. SEE APPENDIX 8, CORNEAL CULTURE PROCEDURE. \\4. A corneal biopsy may be required if the condition is worsening and infection is still suspected despite negative cultures. \\5. For an impending or a complete corneal perforation, a corneal transplant or patch graft is considered. Cyanoacrylate tissue glue may also work in a treated corneal ulcer that has perforated despite infection control. Due to concern about drug penetration, antibiotics are often given for 1 to 2 days prior to glue application over an active area of infection. NOTE: Outpatients are told to return immediately if the pain increases, vision decreases, or they notice an increase in the size of the ulcer when they look in the mirror. 4.12 Fungal Keratitis ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/the_wills_eye/:309:0","tags":["eye"],"title":"The Wills Eye Manual","uri":"/en/the_wills_eye/"},{"categories":["eye"],"content":"Symptoms Pain, photophobia, redness, tearing, discharge, foreign body sensation.

However, the initial clinical response to treatment in fungal keratitis is much slower compared to bacterial keratitis. Stability of infection after initiation of treatment is often a favorable sign. Unlike bacterial ulcers, epithelial healing in fungal keratitis is not always a sign of positive response. Fungal infections in deep corneal stroma are frequently recalcitrant to therapy. These ulcers may require weeks to months of treatment, and therapeutic corneal transplantation may be necessary for infections that progress despite maximal medical therapy or corneal perforation. Intracameral antifungal medications (e.g., voriconazole 50 mcg/0.1 mL) at the time of therapeutic keratoplasty should be considered.

NOTE: Acanthamoeba keratitis should be considered in any patient with a history of soft contact lens wear, poor contact lens hygiene (e.g., using tap water to clean lenses, infrequent disinfection), and/or history of trauma or exposure to water (swimming, fishing, hot tub use) while wearing contact lenses. Although most patients with Acanthamoeba have a history of contact lens use, some patients do not and often have a delayed diagnosis. Cultures for bacteria are negative (unless superinfection present). The condition usually does not improve with antibiotic or antiviral medications and commonly follows a chronic, progressive, downhill course. Acanthamoeba is important to consider in patients with seemingly unresponsive HSV keratitis, as HSV keratitis usually responds well to appropriate treatment.

Consider cycloplegic agent (e.g., cyclopentolate 1% t.i.d.) if an anterior chamber reaction or photophobia is present. \\3. Patients taking topical steroids should have them tapered rapidly. \\4. Limited debridement of infected epithelium can be used as an adjunct to antiviral agents. • Technique: After topical anesthetic instillation, a sterile, moistened cotton-tipped applicator or semisharp instrument is used carefully to peel off the lesions at the slit lamp. After debridement, antiviral treatment should be instituted or continued as described earlier. \\5. For epithelial defects that do not resolve after 1 to 2 weeks, bacterial coinfection or Acanthamoeba keratitis should be suspected. Noncompliance and topical antiviral toxicity should also be considered. At that point, the topical antiviral agent should be discontinued, and a nonpreserved artificial tear ointment or an antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin) should be used four to eight times per day for several days with careful follow-up. Smears for Acanthamoeba should be performed whenever the diagnosis is suspected.

Disciform keratitis Mild. Consider treatment with cycloplegic (e.g., cyclopentolate 1% t.i.d.) in conjunction with antiviral prophylaxis. Moderate to severe or central (i.e., vision is reduced). • Cycloplegic, as above. • Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% or loteprednol 0.5% q.i.d. to q2h). If an epithelial lesion is present, it should be treated before starting high frequency corticosteroids. • Antiviral prophylaxis: Ganciclovir 0.15% ophthalmic gel three to five times a day, trifluridine 1% t.i.d. to q.i.d., acyclovir 400 mg p.o. b.i.d., valacyclovir 500 mg p.o. one to two times a day. NOTE: Chronic use of prophylactic oral antivirals may help prevent subsequent episodes of HSV keratouveitis. • Adjunctive medications which may be used include: • Topical antibiotic (e.g., erythromycin ointment q.h.s.) in the presence of epithelial defects. • Aqueous suppressants for increased IOP. Avoid prostaglandin analogues due to association with recurrent HSV infections and uveitis. \\2. Necrotizing IK: Treated as severe disciform keratitis. The first priority is to diagnose and treat any associated overlying epithelial defect and bacterial superinfection with antibiotic drops or ointment (SEE 4.11, BACTERIAL KERATITIS) . Tissue adhesive or corneal transplantation may be required if the cornea perforates (this is more common with neurotrophic keratitis). Oral antiviral treatment may be beneficial. NOTE: \\1. Topical steroids are contraindicated in those with infectious epithelial disease. \\2. Rarely, a systemic steroid (e.g., prednisone 40 to 60 mg p.o. daily tapered rapidly) is given to patients with severe stromal disease accompanied by an epithelial defect and hypopyon. Cultures should be done to rule out a superinfection. \\3. While oral antivirals (e.g., acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir) have not been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of stromal disease, they are typically employed, and may be beneficial in the treatment of herpetic uveitis (SEE 12.1, ANTERIOR UVEITIS [IRITIS/IRIDOCYCLITIS]). \\4. Valacyclovir has greater bioavailability than acyclovir. Little has been published on famciclovir for HSV, but it may be better tolerated in patients who have side effects to acyclovir such as headache, fatigue, or gastrointestinal upset. \\5. Dosing of antivirals discussed above (e.g., acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir) need to be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. Checking BUN and creatinine is recommended in patients at risk for renal disease before starting high doses of these medications. \\6. Valacyclovir should be used with caution in patients with human immunodeficiency virus due to reports of thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome in this population. \\7. The persistence of an ulcer with stromal keratitis is commonly due to the underlying inflammation (requiring cautious steroid therapy); however, it may be due to antiviral toxicity or active HSV epithelial infection. When an ulcer deepens, a new infiltrate develops, or the anterior chamber reaction increases, smears and cultures should be taken for bacteria and fungi. SEE APPENDIX 8, CORNEAL CULTURE PROCEDURE.

Patients are reexamined in 2 to 7 days to evaluate the response to treatment and then every 1 to 2 weeks, depending on the clinical findings. The following clinical parameters are evaluated: the size of the epithelial defect and ulcer, the corneal thickness and the depth of corneal involvement, the anterior chamber reaction, and the IOP (SEE 9.7, INFLAMMATORY OPEN ANGLE GLAUCOMA , for glaucoma management). Patients with necrotizing keratitis need to be followed daily or admitted if there is threat of perforation. \\2. Topical antiviral medications for corneal dendrites and geographic ulcers should be continued five times (for ganciclovir and vidarabine ophthalmic gel) to nine times (for trifluridine drops) per day for 7 to 14 days until healed, then two to four times per day respectively for 4 to 7 days, then stopped. \\3. Topical steroids used for corneal stromal disease are tapered slowly (often over months to years). The initial concentration of the steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1%) is eventually reduced (e.g., loteprednol 0.5% or prednisolone acetate 0.125%). Extended taper includes dosing q.o.d., twice weekly, once weekly, etc., especially with a history of flare-ups when steroids are stopped. Prophylactic systemic agents (e.g., acyclovir 400 mg b.i.d.) or less commonly, topical antiviral agents (e.g., ganciclovir 0.15% or trifluridine 1% t.i.d.), are used until steroids are used once daily or less. \\4. Corneal transplantation may eventually be necessary if inactive postherpetic scars significantly affect vision, though an RGP lens and maximization of the ocular surface with aggressive lubrication should be tried first. \\5. Recommend long-term oral antiviral prophylaxis (e.g., acyclovir 400 mg b.i.d.) if a patient has had multiple episodes of epithelial disease or stromal disease. NOTE: Topical antivirals can cause a local toxic or allergic reaction (usually a papillary or follicular conjunctivitis) typically after 3 weeks of therapy. In this setting, the patient can be switched to an oral antiviral agent. 4.16 Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus/Varicella Zoster Virus ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/the_wills_eye/:333:0","tags":["eye"],"title":"The Wills Eye Manual","uri":"/en/the_wills_eye/"},{"categories":["eye"],"content":"Symptoms Dermatomal pain, paresthesias, and skin rash or discomfort.

Recommend neurologic consultation to rule out central nervous system involvement. Patients with severe disease can develop a large vessel cranial arteritis resulting in a massive CVA. \\9. Increased IOP: May be steroid response or secondary to inflammation. If uveitis is present, increase the frequency of the steroid administration for a few days and use topical aqueous suppressants (e.g., timolol 0.5% daily or b.i.d., brimonidine 0.2% t.i.d., or dorzolamide 2% t.i.d.; SEE 9.7, INFLAMMATORY OPEN ANGLE GLAUCOMA, AND 9.9, STEROID-RESPONSE GLAUCOMA) .

NOTE: Pain may be severe during the first 2 weeks, and narcotic analgesics may be required. An antidepressant (e.g., amitriptyline 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.) may be beneficial for both postherpetic neuralgia and depression that can develop in VZV. Capsaicin 0.025% or doxepin ointment may be applied to the skin t.i.d. to q.i.d. after the rash heals (not around the eyes) for postherpetic neuralgia. Oral gabapentin or pregabalin can be helpful for acute pain and for postherpetic neuralgia.

Must always be ruled out in contact lens patients with eye pain. SEE 4.11, BACTERIAL KERATITIS, 4.12, FUNGAL KERATITIS, AND 4.13, ACANTHAMOEBA KERATITIS . • Giant papillary conjunctivitis: Itching, mucous discharge, and lens intolerance in a patient with large superior tarsal conjunctival papillae. SEE 4.21, CONTACT LENS-INDUCED GIANT PAPILLARY CONJUNCTIVITIS . • Hypersensitivity/toxicity reactions to preservatives in solutions: Conjunctival injection and ocular irritation typically develop shortly after lens cleaning and insertion, but can be present chronically. A recent change from one type or brand of solution is common. Occurs more often in patients using older preserved solutions (e.g., thimerosal or chlorhexidine as a component), but also is seen with newer “all-purpose” solutions. May be due to inadequate rinsing of lenses after enzyme use. Signs include SPK, conjunctival injection, bulbar conjunctival follicles, subepithelial or stromal corneal infiltrates, superior epithelial irregularities, and superficial scarring. • Contact lens deposits: Multiple small deposits on the contact lens, leading to corneal and conjunctival irritation. The contact lens is often old and may not have been cleaned or enzyme-treated properly in the past. • Tight lens syndrome: Symptoms may be severe and often develop within 1 or 2 days of contact lens fitting (usually a soft lens), especially if patient sleeps overnight with daily-wear lenses. No lens movement with blinking and lens appears “sucked-on” to the cornea (this can occur after rewearing a soft lens that has dried out and then been rehydrated). An imprint in the conjunctiva is often observed after the lens is removed. Central corneal edema, SPK, anterior chamber reaction, and sometimes a sterile hypopyon may develop. • Corneal warpage: Seen predominantly in long-term polymethylmethacrylate hard contact lens wearers. Initially, the vision becomes blurred with glasses (“spectacle blur”) but remains good with contact lenses. Keratometry reveals distorted mires and corneal topography shows irregular astigmatism that eventually resolves after lens discontinuation. • Corneal neovascularization: Patients are often asymptomatic until the visual axis is involved. Superficial corneal neovascularization for 1 mm is common and usually not a concern in aphakic contact lens wearers. With any sign of chronic hypoxia, the goal is to increase oxygen permeability, increase movement, and discontinue extended-wear lenses. • Dry eyes/inadequate/incomplete blinking/thick RGP lenses: Can lead to chronic inflammation, staining, and in some cases scarring, at the 3- and 9-o’clock positions. • Contact lens keratopathy (pseudosuperior limbic keratoconjunctivitis): Hyperemia and fluorescein staining of the superior bulbar conjunctiva, particularly at the limbus. SPK, subepithelial infiltrates, stromal haze, and irregularity may be found on the superior cornea. This may represent a hypersensitivity or toxicity reaction to preservatives in contact lens solutions (classically thimerosal, but newer preservatives as well). No corneal filaments, papillary reaction, or association with thyroid disease. • Displaced contact lens: Most commonly the lens has actually fallen out of the eye and been lost. If retained, the lens is usually found in the superior fornix and may require double eversion of the upper eyelid to remove. Fluorescein will stain a soft lens to aid in finding it. • Others: Contact lens inside out, corneal abrasion (SEE 3.2, CORNEAL ABRASION) , poor lens fit, damaged contact lens, change in refractive error.

Peripheral (unilateral or bilateral) corneal thinning/ulcers may be associated with inflammatory infiltrates. May progress circumferentially to involve the entire peripheral cornea. Perforation may occur. This may be the first manifestation of systemic disease (See Figure 4.22.1 ). • Terrien marginal degeneration: Usually bilateral, often asymptomatic. Slowly progressive thinning of the peripheral cornea; typically superior; more often in men. The anterior chamber is quiet, and the eye is typically not injected. A yellow line (lipid) may appear, with a fine pannus over the thinned areas of involvement. The thinning may slowly spread circumferentially. Refractive changes, including irregular and against-the-rule astigmatism are often present. The epithelium usually remains intact, but perforation may occur with minor trauma. • Mooren ulcer: Unilateral or bilateral. Painful corneal thinning and ulceration with inflammation. Initially starts as a focal area in the peripheral cornea, nasally or temporally with involvement of the limbus; later extends circumferentially or centrally. An epithelial defect, stromal thinning, and a leading undermined edge are present. Limbal blood vessels may grow into the ulcer, and perforation can occur. Idiopathic (autoimmunity may play a key role); diagnosis of exclusion. Mooren-like ulcer has been associated with systemic hepatitis C virus infection. • Pellucid marginal degeneration: Painless, bilateral asymmetric corneal thinning of the inferior peripheral cornea (usually from the 4- to 8-o’clock portions). There is no anterior chamber reaction, conjunctival injection, lipid deposition, or vascularization. The epithelium is intact. Corneal protrusion may be seen above the area of thinning. The thinning may slowly progress. Figure 4.22.1. Peripheral ulcerative keratitis. • Furrow degeneration: Painless corneal thinning just peripheral to an arcus senilis, typically in the elderly. Noninflammatory without vascularization. Perforation is rare. Usually nonprogressive and does not require treatment. • Delle: Painless oval corneal thinning resulting from corneal drying and stromal dehydration adjacent to an abnormal conjunctival or corneal elevation. The epithelium may be intact. SEE 4.23, DELLE . • Staphylococcal hypersensitivity/marginal keratitis: Peripheral, white corneal infiltrate(s) with limbal clearing that may have an epithelial defect and mild thinning. SEE 4.18, STAPHYLOCOCCAL HYPERSENSITIVITY . • Dry eye syndrome: Peripheral (or central) sterile corneal melts may result from severe cases of dry eye. SEE 4.3, DRY EYE SYNDROME . • Exposure/neurotrophic keratopathy: In severe cases, a sterile oval ulcer may develop inferiorly on the cornea without signs of significant inflammation. May be associated with an eyelid abnormality, a fifth or seventh cranial nerve defect, or proptosis. The ulcer may become superinfected. SEE 4.5, EXPOSURE KERATOPATHY AND 4.6, NEUROTROPHIC KERATOPATHY . • Sclerokeratitis: Corneal ulceration may be associated with scleritis. Scleral edema with or without nodules develop, scleral vessels become engorged, and the sclera may develop a blue hue. An underlying connective tissue disease, especially granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener disease), must be ruled out. SEE 5.7, SCLERITIS . • Ocular rosacea: Typically affects the inferior cornea in middle-aged patients. Erythema and telangiectasia of the eyelid margins, corneal neovascularization. SEE 5.9, OCULAR ROSACEA . • Others: Cataract surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, previous HSV or VZV infections, and leukemia can rarely cause peripheral corneal thinning/ulceration.

Corneal thinning due to connective tissue disease: Management is usually coordinated with an internist or rheumatologist. • Ophthalmic antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin ointment q2h) or preservative-free ointment. • Cycloplegic drops (e.g., cylopentolate 1% or atropine 1% b.i.d. to t.i.d.) when an anterior chamber reaction or pain is present. • Consider doxycycline 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. for its metalloproteinase inhibition properties and ascorbic acid (vitamin C 1 to 2 g daily) as a collagen synthesis promoter. • Systemic steroids (e.g., prednisone 60 to 100 mg p.o. daily; dosage is adjusted according to the response) and antiulcer prophylaxis (e.g., ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. or pantoprazole 40 mg daily) are used for significant and progressive corneal thinning, but not for perforation. • An immunosuppressive agent (e.g., methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, infliximab, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide) is often required, especially for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener disease). This should be done in coordination with the patient’s internist or rheumatologist. • Excision of adjacent inflamed conjunctiva is occasionally helpful when the condition progresses despite treatment. • Punctal occlusion if dry eye syndrome is present. Topical cyclosporine 0.05% to 2% b.i.d. to q.i.d. may also be helpful. Oral omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial for moderate–severe dry eye syndrome. SEE 4.3, DRY EYE SYNDROME . • Consider cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive or corneal transplantation surgery for an impending or actual corneal perforation. A conjunctival flap or amniotic membrane graft can also be used for an impending corneal perforation. • Patients with significant corneal thinning should wear their glasses (or protective glasses [e.g., polycarbonate lens]) during the day and an eye shield at night. NOTE: Topical steroids are usually not used in the presence of significant corneal thinning because of the risk of perforation. Gradually taper topical steroids if the patient is already taking them. Corneal thinning due to relapsing polychondritis, however, may improve with topical steroids (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% q1–2h). \\2. Terrien marginal degeneration: Correct astigmatism with glasses or contact lenses if possible. Protective eyewear should be worn if significant thinning is present. Lamellar grafts can be performed if thinning is extreme. \\3. Mooren ulcer: Underlying systemic diseases must be ruled out before this diagnosis can be made. Topical corticosteroids, topical cyclosporine 0.05% to 2%, limbal conjunctival excision, corneal gluing, and lamellar keratoplasty may be beneficial. Systemic immunosuppressants (e.g., oral corticosteroids, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine) are indicated and may be lifesaving. See treatment for corneal thinning secondary to connective tissue disease above. \\4. Pellucid marginal degeneration: SEE 4.24, KERATOCONUS . \\5. Furrow degeneration: No treatment is required.

COMPLICATIONS OF SURFACE ABLATION PROCEDURES (PHOTOREFRACTIVE KERATECTOMY, LASER SUBEPITHELIAL KERATECTOMY, AND EPITHELIAL-LASER IN SITU KERATOMILEUSIS) In PRK, the corneal epithelium is removed and the corneal stroma is ablated using an argon-fluoride excimer laser (193 nm, ultraviolet) to correct a refractive error. In laser subepithelial keratomileusis (LASEK), the epithelium is chemically separated from the Bowman layer, moved to the side before laser ablation of the stroma, and then repositioned centrally. In epithelial-laser in situ keratomileusis (epi-LASIK), the epithelium is mechanically separated from the Bowman layer, moved to the side before laser ablation of the stroma, and then repositioned centrally or discarded (see Table 4.29.1 ).

COMPLICATIONS OF RADIAL KERATOTOMY In radial keratotomy (RK), partial-thickness, spoke-like cuts are made in the peripheral cornea using a diamond blade (often 90% to 95% depth), which results in a flattening of the central cornea and correction of myopia.

Viral conjunctivitis is highly contagious (usually for 10 to 12 days from onset) as long as the eyes are red (when not on steroids) or have active discharge/tearing. Patients should avoid touching their eyes, shaking hands, sharing towels or pillows, etc. Restrict work and school for patients with significant exposure to others while the eyes are red and weeping. \\3. Frequent handwashing. \\4. Preservative-free artificial tears or tear ointment four to eight times per day for 1 to 3 weeks.

Antihistamine drops (e.g., epinastine 0.05% b.i.d.) if itching is severe. \\7. If a membrane/pseudomembrane is present, it should be gently peeled with a cotton-tip applicator or smooth forceps to enhance comfort, minimize corneal defects, and help prevent symblepharon formation. \\8. If a membrane/pseudomembrane is present or if SEIs reduce vision and/or cause significant photophobia, topical steroids should be initiated. For membranes/pseudomembranes, use a more frequent steroid dose or stronger steroid (e.g., loteprednol 0.5% or prednisolone acetate 1% q.i.d.). Consider a steroid ointment (e.g., fluorometholone 0.1% ointment q.i.d. or dexamethasone/tobramycin 0.1%/0.3% ointment q.i.d.) in the presence of significant tearing to maintain longer medication exposure. For SEIs alone, a weaker steroid with less frequent dosing is usually sufficient (e.g., loteprednol 0.2% or 0.5% b.i.d.). Given the possible side effects, prescription of topical steroids is cautionary in the emergency room setting or in patients with questionable follow-up. Steroids may hasten the resolution of the symptoms but prolong the infectious period. Additionally, steroids often necessitate a long-term taper and delayed SEIs can recur during or after such a taper. NOTE: Routine use of topical antibiotics for viral conjunctivitis is discouraged unless corneal erosions are present or there is mucopurulent discharge suggestive of bacterial conjunctivitis (SEE BACTERIAL CONJUNCTIVITIS).

Diffuse and nodular scleritis: One or more of the following may be required. Concurrent antiulcer medication (e.g., proton-pump inhibitor [e.g., omeprazole 20 mg p.o. daily] or histamine type 2 receptor blocker [e.g., ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.]) may be helpful. • Oral NSAIDs (e.g., flurbiprofen 100 mg t.i.d., naproxen 250 to 500 mg p.o. b.i.d., or indomethacin 25 to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.): Several different NSAIDs may be tried before therapy is considered a failure. If still no improvement, consider systemic steroids. • Oral steroids: Prednisone 60 to 80 mg p.o. daily for 1 week, followed by a taper to 20 mg daily over the next 2 to 6 weeks, followed by a slower taper. Once daily calcium with Vitamin D (e.g., 600 mg with 400 iU) supplements should be given to reduce risk of osteoporosis. An oral NSAID often facilitates the tapering of the steroid but significantly increases the risk of gastric ulceration. If unsuccessful or disease requires \u003e7.5 to 10 mg prednisone/day for long-term control, immunosuppressive therapy is indicated. • Intravenous steroids: Methylprednisolone succinate 1,000 mg daily for 3 days (followed by oral steroids as above) is preferable to prednisone \u003e80 mg/day because of reduced risk of ischemic necrosis of bone. • Immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, anti-TNFα agents, other biologics): If one drug is ineffective or not tolerated, additional agents should be tried. Systemic steroids may be used in conjunction. Immunosuppressive therapy should be coordinated with an internist, rheumatologist, or uveitis specialist. Topical cyclosporine is rarely effective. • Conventional teaching is that topical therapy is of little benefit. However, difluprednate 0.05% drops are sometimes helpful (with or without a topical NSAID) and thus, in mild cases, may spare the need for systemic immunosuppressive agents. • Subconjunctival steroid injections (e.g., 0.1 to 0.3 mL of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg/mL or dexamethasone sodium phosphate 4 mg/mL): May be very helpful in patients unable to tolerate systemic therapy. Side effects may include subconjunctival hemorrhage, cataract, glaucoma, and (rarely) catastrophic scleral melting. Do not use in cases of necrotizing scleritis. \\2. Necrotizing scleritis: • Necrotizing scleritis associated with rheumatoid arthritis is associated with increased mortality due to coronary arteritis or cerebral angiitis and requires urgent, aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. • Systemic steroids and immunosuppressive therapies are used as above during the first month; the former is tapered slowly. • Scleral patch grafting may be necessary if there is significant risk of perforation, ideally once the inflammation is better controlled. \\3. Posterior scleritis: Therapy may include systemic aspirin, NSAIDs, steroids, or immunosuppressive therapy as described previously. Consult a retina or uveitis specialist. \\4. Infectious etiologies: Debridement and cultures/stains are essential. Treat with appropriate topical and systemic antimicrobials. Oral fluoroquinolones have good ocular tissue penetration. If a foreign body (e.g., scleral buckle [associated with Proteus or Pseudomonas]) is present, surgical removal is indicated. \\5. Glasses or eye shield should be worn at all times if there is significant thinning and risk of perforation.

Immunosuppressive agents (e.g., mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulin) are typically used for progressive disease. \\8. Dapsone is occasionally used for progressive disease.

Dapsone is maintained for several months and tapered slowly. NOTE: Dapsone can cause a dose-related hemolysis. A complete blood count and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) level must be checked before administration. Dapsone should be avoided in patients with G-6-PD deficiency. A complete blood count with reticulocyte count is obtained weekly as the dose is increased every 3 to 4 weeks until blood counts are stable and then every few months. \\9. Consider surgical correction of entropion and cryotherapy or electrolysis for trichiasis. Surgery carries risk of further scarring and is best performed when inflammation is absent. \\10. Mucous membrane grafts (e.g., buccal or amniotic membrane graft) can be used to reconstruct the fornices if needed. \\11. Consider a keratoprosthesis in an end-stage eye with good macular and optic nerve function if the inflammation and IOP are controlled.

Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) (particularly Kearns–Sayre syndrome, SEE 10.12, CHRONIC PROGRESSIVE EXTERNAL OPHTHALMOPLEGIA) . *Figure 6.1.1* Ptosis. Categories: • Myogenic: Congenital myogenic ptosis is present at birth with poor levator function and a poor or absent lid crease due to dysgenesis of the levator muscle, fibrosis, and its replacement with adipose tissue. A poor Bell phenomenon, lagophthalmos in downgaze, and upgaze limitation may indicate a double elevator palsy. Acquired myogenic ptosis is uncommon and may be seen with muscular dystrophy and CPEO. • Aponeurotic: This is characterized by a high or absent eyelid crease, moderate degree of ptosis, good levator function (10 to 15 mm). May worsen in downgaze. Levator stretching or dehiscence can be due to normal aging, repetitive eye rubbing, use of rigid contact lenses, or previous intraocular surgery. • Neurogenic: Third CN palsy (often complete ptosis, never an isolated abnormality; congenital, compressive, vasculopathic, SEE 10.5, ISOLATED THIRD NERVE PALSY ); Horner syndrome (subtle upper and lower eyelid ptosis, SEE 10.2, HORNER SYNDROME ); myasthenia gravis (variable ptosis, worsens with fatigue, SEE 10.11, MYASTHENIA GRAVIS ); Marcus Gunn jaw-winking syndrome (ptotic eyelid elevates with jaw movement); ophthalmoplegic migraine; multiple sclerosis. • Mechanical: Retained contact lens in upper fornix; upper eyelid or forniceal inflammation (chalazion, giant papillary conjunctivitis, posttraumatic or postsurgical edema) or neoplasm. • Traumatic: History of eyelid laceration with levator transection, contusion injury to the levator, tethering or ischemia within an orbital roof fracture, late dehiscence or cicatricial changes. • Pseudoptosis: Contralateral eyelid retraction or proptosis, ipsilateral enophthalmos or hypertropia, microphthalmia, phthisis bulbi, dermatochalasis, brow ptosis, chalazion or other eyelid tumor, eyelid edema, blepharospasm, Duane syndrome.

History: Determine the onset and duration of ptosis. Present since birth? Acute onset? Old photographs (e.g., driver’s license) and family members’ opinions are useful adjuncts to the history. History of surgery in either eye? Orbital or eyelid trauma? Variability with fatigue? Associated with diplopia, headache, or neck pain? Any history of autoimmune disease (lupus, Sjögren syndrome) or corneal abnormalities (may predispose the patient to postoperative exposure keratopathy)? \\2. Mandatory documentation: Must carefully check and document pupillary size and extraocular motility, even if normal. If anisocoria is present, measurements should be documented under light and dark conditions. Additional pharmacologic testing may be indicated (SEE 10.1, ANISOCORIA ). If extraocular muscle dysfunction is noted, additional testing with prism bars may be indicated. \\3. Complete orbital examination of both eyes: Measure and compare globe position, margin reflex distance, levator function (full upper eyelid excursion while preventing frontalis muscle assistance), and upper eyelid crease position of both eyes. Is there lagophthalmos? Associated lower eyelid “ptosis” (elevation of ipsilateral lower eyelid) is often seen in Horner syndrome. Proptosis or eyelid lag may masquerade as contralateral ptosis. Exophthalmometry measurements are useful. Any sign of aberrant eyelid movements like jaw winking, variability and/or fatigue, orbicularis weakness, eyelid retraction with adduction and/or infraduction? Palpate the superior orbit to rule out a mass or superior orbital rim deformity. \\4. Complete ocular examination: Flip upper eyelid to examine conjunctival surface and superior fornix. Dilated fundus examination to look for pigmentary changes in adolescents and young adults who present with ptosis, poor levator function, and external ophthalmoplegia (possible CPEO). \\5. Corneal protective mechanisms. Document the presence or absence of preoperative lagophthalmos, orbicularis function, Bell phenomenon, and tear production. Check the cornea carefully for any abnormalities or dystrophies, which may predispose the patient to postoperative keratopathy. \\6. Other tests • Ice test: Apply ice pack to ptotic eye(s) for 2 minutes and reassess the degree of ptosis. Improvement with ice is highly suggestive of myasthenia gravis. • Neosynephrine test: Instill one drop of 2.5% phenylephrine in the ptotic eye(s) and reassess the degree of ptosis. Patients with improvement of ptosis after 5 to 7 minutes may be good candidates for ptosis correction by an internal approach. • Apraclonidine, cocaine, and hydroxyamphetamine tests. SEE 10.2, HORNER SYNDROME . NOTE: In recent years, limited access to ophthalmic cocaine and hydroxyamphetamine has reduced their utility in the clinical setting. \\7. Imaging studies: In very select cases where a systemic or neurologic cause is suspected: • Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of orbit if a superior orbital mass is suspected. • Emergent CT/computed tomography angiogram (CTA) or MRI/magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) of the head and neck if carotid artery dissection is suspected in a patient with a painful Horner syndrome. Imaging of the head alone is inadequate. SEE 10.2, HORNER SYNDROME . • Emergent CT/CTA, MRI/MRA, or conventional angiography if intracranial aneurysm causing a third CN palsy with pupillary involvement or a partial third CN palsy is suspected. SEE 10.5, ISOLATED THIRD NERVE PALSY . • Chest CT if either Horner syndrome (to rule out apical lung mass compressing sympathetic ganglion) or myasthenia gravis (to rule out thymoma) is suspected.

If the chalazion fails to resolve after 3 to 4 weeks of appropriate medical therapy and the patient wishes to have it removed, incision and curettage are performed. Occasionally, an injection of steroid (e.g., 0.2 to 1.0 mL of triamcinolone 40 mg/mL usually mixed 1:1 with 2% lidocaine with epinephrine) into the lesion is performed instead of minor surgery, especially if the chalazion is near the lacrimal apparatus. The total dosage depends on the size of the lesion. All recurrent or atypical chalazia must be sent for pathology. NOTE: A steroid injection can lead to permanent depigmentation or atrophy of the skin at the injection site, especially in dark-skinned individuals. Similarly, vigorous injection can rarely result in retrograde intra-arterial infiltration with resultant central retinal artery occlusion. Because of these risks, some manufacturers of injectable steroids (e.g., triamcinolone, dexamethasone, and betamethasone) have historically recommended against their use intraocularly and in the periocular region.

Brown-black, well-circumscribed, crust-like lesion, usually slightly elevated, with or without surrounding inflammation. May be removed by shave biopsy. • Chalazion/Hordeolum: Acute, erythematous, tender, well-circumscribed lesion. SEE 6.2, CHALAZION/HORDEOLUM . • Cysts: Well-circumscribed white, yellow, or clear/skin-colored lesions on the eyelid margin or underneath the skin. Epidermal inclusion cysts, sebaceous cysts, and eccrine or apocrine hydrocystomas may be excised. • Molluscum contagiosum: A viral infection of the epidermis, typically seen in children. Multiple small papules characterized by a central umbilication. Can be severe in HIV-positive patients. May produce a chronic follicular conjunctivitis. Treat lesions by unroofing and curettage. While some recommend curettage until bleeding occurs, there is no clear evidence that this is more effective. A variety of other therapies (e.g., cryotherapy, cautery, chemical, laser) are used for lesions found elsewhere on the body but are typically not necessary for periocular regions and may cause injury to the ocular surfaces. SEE 5.2, CHRONIC CONJUNCTIVITIS . • Nevus: Incompletely differentiated melanocytes that can clump at the epidermis, dermis, or the junction of the two layers. Congenital nevi may be present at, or shortly after, birth; however, most nevi appear during childhood and may enlarge during puberty. Nevi are well-circumscribed lesions, usually round or oval, with uniform pigmentation. Melanomas may develop within pre-existing nevi and may manifest as a changing pigmented lesion and/or as a pigmented lesion with asymmetry of shape, irregular borders, color variegation, and possibly pruritus or bleeding. Suspicious lesions should be biopsied, preferably with removal of the entire lesion to the subcutaneous fat. • Xanthelasma: Multiple, often bilateral, soft yellow plaques of lipid-laden macrophages in the upper and sometimes lower eyelids. Patients 40 years and younger should have a serum cholesterol and lipid profile evaluation to rule out hypercholesterolemia. Surgical excision can be performed for cosmesis; however, recurrence is possible. • Squamous papilloma: Soft, skin-colored lesions that may be smooth, rounded, or pedunculated. May enlarge or multiply over time. Often spontaneously regress. Occasionally squamous carcinomas can appear papillomatous. Therefore, excisional biopsy should be performed for suspicious lesions. • Actinic keratosis: Round, erythematous, premalignant lesion with scaly surface. Found in sun-exposed areas of skin. Treat with excisional biopsy. • Inflammatory conditions: Blepharitis, blepharoconjunctivitis. • Allergic conditions: Chronic contact dermatitis can appear unilateral, cause cilia loss, and simulate malignancy. • Others: Verrucae from human papillomavirus, benign tumors of hair follicles or sweat glands (e.g., syringoma), inverted follicular keratosis, neurofibroma, neurilemmoma, capillary hemangioma, cavernous hemangioma, and pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia. Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma nodules of multiple myeloma appear as yellow plaques or nodules are often mistaken for xanthelasma.

Rarely metastasizes but may be locally invasive, particularly when it is present in the medial canthal region. There are two forms: • Nodular: Indurated, firm mass, commonly with telangiectases over the tumor margins. Sometimes the center of the lesion is ulcerated (See Figure 6.11.1 ). On rare occasions, a cystic variant is seen. • Morpheaform: Firm, flat, subcutaneous lesion with indistinct borders. More difficult to excise and may result in a large eyelid defect. • Sebaceous carcinoma: More common in middle-aged or elderly patients, usually elderly women. Most common on the upper eyelid but may be multifocal, involving both the upper and the lower eyelids. Often confused with recurrent chalazia or intractable blepharitis. Loss of eyelashes and destruction of the meibomian gland orifices in the region of the tumor may occur. Regional and systemic metastasis or orbital extension is possible. Can occur many decades after prior radiation exposure to the eyelids (See Figure 6.11.2 ). • Squamous cell carcinoma: Variable presentation, often appearing similar to a basal cell carcinoma. Regional metastasis may occur and can be extensive with a propensity for perineural invasion. A premalignant lesion, actinic keratosis, may appear either as a scaly, erythematous flat lesion or as a cutaneous horn. *Figure 6.11.1* Basal cell carcinoma. *Figure 6.11.2* Sebaceous carcinoma. • Keratoacanthoma: This lesion was previously considered to be benign and self-limiting; however, it is now regarded as a low-grade squamous cell carcinoma. Clinically may resemble basal and squamous cell carcinomas. Typically, the lesion is elevated with rolled margins and a large central ulcer filled with keratin. Rapid growth with slow regression and even spontaneous resolution has been observed. Lesions usually involve the lower eyelid and can be destructive. Complete excision is recommended. • Others: Malignant melanoma, lymphoma, sweat gland carcinoma, metastasis (usually breast or lung), Merkel cell tumor, Kaposi sarcoma, and others.

Basal cell carcinoma: Surgical excision with histologic evaluation of the tumor margins either by frozen sections or by Mohs techniques. The entire tumor should be excised with clean margins. Cryotherapy and radiation are used rarely. Topical imiquimod, an immune modulator, is a newer treatment that might be beneficial but could be toxic to the surface of the eye. Patients are informed about the etiologic role of the sun and are advised to avoid unnecessary sunlight exposure and to use protective sunscreens. \\2. Sebaceous carcinoma: The approach is two-staged with stage 1 using map biopsies on the entire surface of the eye to ascertain the extent of Pagetoid spread or deep tumor. Stage 2 is performed after all biopsies are reviewed; Pagetoid spread is treated with cryotherapy whereas deep tumor requires excision. Reconstruction is then provided. Close follow-up of regional nodes is indicated. Exenteration is often required when orbital invasion is present. Referral to an oncologist or internist for systemic work-up and surveillance is important with attention to the lymph nodes, lungs, brain, liver, and bone. \\3. Squamous cell carcinoma: Same as for basal cell carcinoma. Radiation therapy is the second best treatment after surgical excision. Topical imiquimod and topical or injectable interferon can be beneficial for elderly patients who are not surgical candidates. Patients are informed about the etiologic role of the sun. Referral to an oncologist or internist for regional and/or systemic work-up and surveillance is important. \\4. Malignant melanoma: Treatment requires wide surgical excision.

Infectious: Orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess (SPA), mucormycosis, etc. \\3. Neoplastic (discrete, infiltrative, or hematologic): Typically categorized as primary (e.g., cavernous hemangioma), or secondary (e.g., extension of sinus mucocele or intracranial meningioma, etc). May be benign, malignant, or metastatic. NOTE: As a general rule, any patient with a history of cancer and a new orbital process should be assumed to have metastatic disease unless proven otherwise. \\4. Trauma: Orbital fracture, retrobulbar hemorrhage, orbital foreign body, carotid–cavernous fistula, etc. \\5. Malformation: Skeletal abnormalities, congenital/genetic syndromes, etc. \\6. Vascular: Usually either congenital or acquired and categorized as primary arterial (e.g., carotid–cavernous fistula) or venous (e.g., varix).

Trauma? History of sinonasal congestion, epistaxis? Smoking? Up to date with health maintenance and age appropriate screenings (e.g., mammography, prostate examination/screening)? \\2. Examination: • Review vital signs, particularly temperature. • Check visual acuity, size and reactivity of pupils, visual fields, color vision, intraocular pressure. Check for pulsatility of semicircles on Goldmann tonometry. • Check extraocular movements. Measure any ocular misalignment ([prisms or Maddox rod], SEE APPENDIX 3, COVER/UNCOVER AND ALTERNATE COVER TESTS AND 10.7, ISOLATED FOURTH NERVE PALSY). Consider a forced duction test in select cases (SEE APPENDIX 6, FORCED DUCTION TEST AND ACTIVE FORCE GENERATION TEST). • Check for proptosis. Tilt the patient’s head back and look from below (“ant’s-eye view”). Measure with a Hertel exophthalmometer. Position the exophthalmometer against the lateral orbital rims, not the lateral canthi. Average value is 17 mm with the upper limit of normal about 22 to 24 mm. A difference between the two eyes of more than 2 mm is considered abnormal. Can be used in conjunction with a Valsalva maneuver if a venous malformation is suspected. In addition to classic axial exophthalmos, also look for nonaxial displacement of the globe (e.g., hypoglobus, hyperglobus). • Test resistance to retropulsion by gently pushing each globe into the orbit with your thumbs. Feel along the orbital rim for a mass. Check the conjunctival cul-de-sacs carefully and evert the upper eyelid. • Check trigeminal and facial nerve function. Check for preauricular and cervical adenopathy. • Perform a dilated examination to evaluate optic nerves (pallor, swelling), posterior pole (especially for chorioretinal folds), and peripheral retina. • Consider automated perimetry if compressive optic neuropathy is suspected. \\3. Imaging studies: Orbital computed tomography (CT) (axial, coronal, and parasagittal views) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium and fat suppression, depending on suspected etiology. Orbital B-scan (US) with or without color Doppler imaging is useful if the diagnosis is uncertain or when a cystic or vascular lesion is suspected. Consider optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess optic nerve contour. SEE CHAPTER 14, IMAGING MODALITIES IN OPHTHALMOLOGY. \\4. Laboratory tests when appropriate: Triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), cytoplasmic staining and perinuclear staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (cANCA and pANCA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), IgG/IgG4 levels, antinuclear antibody (ANA), complete blood count (CBC) with differential, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine (especially if CT contrast or gadolinium is indicated), fasting blood sugar/hemoglobin A1c, blood cultures, etc. \\5. Consider further systemic work-up and additional imaging, depending on clinical suspicion and radiologic findings (metastasis, lymphoma, etc.). \\6. Consider an excisional or incisional biopsy, as dictated by the working diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy has a limited role in orbital diagnosis. Additional work-up, treatment, and follow-up vary according to the suspected diagnosis.

Critical. Retraction of the upper eyelids with lateral flare (highly specific) and eyelid lag on downward gaze (von Graefe sign), lagophthalmos. Lower lid retraction is a very nonspecific sign and often present as a normal finding. Unilateral or bilateral axial proptosis with variable resistance to retropulsion. When extraocular muscles are involved, elevation and abduction are commonly restricted and there is resistance on forced duction testing. Although often bilateral, unilateral or asymmetric TED is also frequently seen. Thickening of the extraocular muscles (inferior, medial, superior, and lateral, in order of frequency) without involvement of the associated tendons may be noted on orbital imaging. Isolated enlargement of lateral rectus muscles is highly atypical of TED and requires further work-up and possibly biopsy. Isolated enlargement of the superior rectus can occur in TED, but should be followed carefully for alternative causes. Other. Reduced blink rate, significantly elevated IOP (especially in upgaze), injection of the blood vessels over the insertion sites of horizontal rectus muscles, superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis, superficial punctate keratopathy, or infiltrate or ulceration from exposure keratopathy, afferent pupillary defect, dyschromatopsia, optic nerve swelling/pallor. NOTE: Thickening of the extraocular muscles at the orbital apex can result in optic nerve compression and manifest in afferent pupillary defect, reduced color vision, visual field, and visual acuity loss. Compressive optic neuropathy occurs in a minority of patients (5%) with TED but must be ruled out in every patient at every visit. The optic neuropathy of TED almost invariably occurs in the setting of restrictive strabismus and increased resistance to retropulsion. Of note, in cases of compressive optic neuropathy from TED, axial proptosis is usually either absent or mild.

If TFTs are normal, the patient’s TFTs should be checked every 6 to 12 months. Not infrequently, a euthyroid patient with TED will have an elevated TSI. \\3. Treat exposure keratopathy with artificial tears and lubrication or by taping eyelids closed at night (SEE 4.5, EXPOSURE KERATOPATHY ). Goggles at night may be helpful. The use of topical cyclosporine drops for the treatment of ocular surface inflammation in TED is still under investigation, but is a reasonable long-term treatment option if dry eye syndrome is present. \\4. Treat eyelid edema with cold compresses in the morning and head elevation at night. This management may not be very effective. Avoid diuretics. \\5. Indications for orbital decompression surgery include: Optic neuropathy, worsening or severe exposure keratopathy despite adequate treatment, globe luxation, uncontrollably high IOP, morbid proptosis. \\6. A stepwise approach is used for surgical treatment, starting with orbital decompression (if needed), followed by strabismus surgery (for significant strabismus, if present), followed by eyelid surgery. Alteration of this sequence may lead to unpredictable results. Note that only a minority of patients with TED will need to undergo the entire surgical algorithm. The following recommendations are somewhat controversial: • Corticosteroids: During the acute inflammatory phase, prednisone 1 mg/kg p.o. daily, tapered over 4 to 6 weeks, is a reasonable temporizing measure to improve proptosis and diplopia in preparation for orbital decompression surgery. There is evidence that the use of pulsed intravenous corticosteroids followed by a course of oral corticosteroids may result in better long-term control of TED with fewer systemic side effects than oral corticosteroids and is a reasonable option to offer patients in the acute phase of TED; other experts questions the long-term efficacy of this regimen. Periorbital corticosteroid injections are also used by some experts, but may be suboptimal to oral corticosteroids. Chronic systemic corticosteroids for long-term management should be avoided because of the systemic side effects. • Orbital radiation: The use and efficacy of orbital radiation in the management of TED remains controversial. It may be used as a modality in the acute inflammatory phase of TED or as a means to limit progression and provide long-term control. Radiation therapy appears to decrease the severity and progression of restrictive strabismus in patients with active TED; efficacy in managing other aspects of TED (including optic neuropathy) has not been proved definitively, but is advocated by some experts. Radiation therapy should be used with caution in patients with diabetes, as it may worsen diabetic retinopathy, and in vasculopaths, as it may increase the risk of radiation retinopathy or optic neuropathy. All patients offered radiation therapy should be informed of the potential risks. If used, radiation is best performed according to strict protocols with carefully controlled dosage and shielding under the supervision of a radiation oncologist familiar with the technique. Typically, a total dose of 2,000 cGy is administered in 10 to 14 fractions over 2 weeks. Treatment may transiently exacerbate inflammatory changes and an oral prednisone taper may mitigate these symptoms. Improvement is often seen within a few weeks of treatment, but may take several months to attain maximal effect. • Selenium supplementation: Data from Europe has concluded that the use of selenium supplementation (an antioxidant) reduces the severity and progression of mild-to-moderate TED.

Admit the patient to the hospital and consider consultation with infectious disease and otorhinolaryngology. \\2. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms are recommended for 48 to 72 hours, followed by oral medication for at least 1 week. The specific antibiotic agents vary. • In patients from the community with no recent history of hospitalization, nursing home stay, or institutional stay, we currently recommend: Ampicillin–sulbactam 3 g i.v. q6h in adults; 300 mg/kg per day in four divided doses in children, maximum daily dose 12 g ampicillin–sulbactam (8 g ampicillin component). or Piperacillin–tazobactam 4.5 g i.v. q8h or 3.375 g q6h in adults; 240 mg of piperacillin component/kg/day in three divided doses in children, maximum daily dose 18 g piperacillin. • In patients suspected of harboring hospital-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA) or in those with suspected meningitis, add concurrent intravenous vancomycin at 15 mg/kg q12–24h in adults with normal renal function and 40 mg/kg per day in two or three divided doses in children, with a maximum daily dose of 2 g. For adults who are allergic to penicillin but can tolerate cephalosporins, use vancomycin as dosed above plus: Ceftriaxone 2 g i.v. daily and metronidazole 500 mg i.v. q6–8h (not to exceed 4 g per day). • For adults who are allergic to penicillin/cephalosporin, treat with a combination of a fluoroquinolone (for patients \u003e17 years of age, moxifloxacin 400 mg i.v. daily or ciprofloxacin 400 mg i.v. q12h or levofloxacin 750 mg i.v. daily) and metronidazole 500 mg i.v. q6–8h. NOTE: Antibiotic dosages may need to be reduced in the presence of renal insufficiency or failure. Peak and trough levels of vancomycin are usually monitored, and dosages are adjusted as needed. BUN and creatinine levels are monitored closely. Also be aware that many antibiotics (especially tetracycline derivatives) may change the efficacy of warfarin and other anticoagulants. It is prudent to obtain internal medicine consultation for management of anticoagulants while the patient is using antibiotics. NOTE: The incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is increasing in the United States, especially in urban areas. It is extremely difficult to clinically distinguish CA-MRSA from more conventional microbial pathogens. CA-MRSA may progress more rapidly and present with greater clinical severity than typical bacterial pathogens, but these are subjective criteria. It is prudent to cover CA-MRSA in severe cases of orbital cellulitis, in cases with a suspected skin source, in cases that have failed conventional therapy, or in areas of high CA-MRSA incidence. CA-MRSA is typically treated with tetracycline or a tetracycline derivative, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is on the rise. \\3. Nasal decongestant spray as needed for up to 3 days. Nasal corticosteroid spray may also be added to quicken the resolution of sinusitis. \\4. Erythromycin or bacitracin ointment q.i.d. for corneal exposure and chemosis if needed. \\5. If the orbit is tight, an optic neuropathy is present, or the IOP is severely elevated, immediate canthotomy/cantholysis may be needed. SEE 3.10, TRAUMATIC RETROBULBAR HEMORRHAGE for indications and technique. \\6. The use of systemic corticosteroids in the management of orbital cellulitis remains controversial. If systemic corticosteroids are considered, it is probably safest to wait 24 to 48 hours until an adequate intravenous antibiotic load has been given (three to four doses).

Severe infections may require multiple daily examinations. Clinical improvement may take 24 to 36 hours. \\1. Progress is monitored by: • Patient’s symptoms. • Temperature and white blood cell (WBC) count. • Visual acuity and evaluation of optic nerve function. • Extraocular motility. • Degree of proptosis and any displacement of the globe (significant displacement may indicate an abscess). NOTE: If clinical deterioration is noted after an adequate antibiotic load (three to four doses), a CT scan of the orbit and brain with contrast should be repeated to look for abscess formation (SEE 7.3.2, SUBPERIOSTEAL ABSCESS) . If an abscess is found, surgical drainage may be required. Because radiographic findings may lag behind the clinical examination, clinical deterioration may be the only indication for surgical drainage. Other conditions that should be considered when the patient is not improving include cavernous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, resistant organism (HA-MRSA, CA-MRSA), aggressive organism (often from an undiagnosed odontogenic source), or a noninfectious etiology. \\2. Evaluate the cornea for signs of exposure. \\3. Check IOP. \\4. Examine the retina and optic nerve for signs of posterior compression (e.g., chorioretinal folds), inflammation, or exudative retinal detachment. \\5. If orbital cellulitis is clearly and consistently improving, then the regimen can be changed to oral antibiotics (depending on the culture and sensitivity results) to complete a 10- to 14-day course. We often use: Amoxicillin/clavulanate: 25 to 45 mg/kg/day p.o. in two divided doses for children, maximum daily dose of 90 mg/kg/day; 875 mg p.o. q12h for adults. or Cefpodoxime: 10 mg/kg/day p.o. in two divided doses for children, maximum daily dose of 400 mg; 200 mg p.o. q12h for adults. or If CA-MRSA is suspected, recommended oral treatment regimens include doxycycline 100 mg p.o. q12h (not in pregnant or nursing women and not in children younger than 8 years), one to two tablets trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg p.o. q12h, clindamycin 450 mg p.o. q6–8h, or linezolid 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. (only with approval by infectious disease specialist given current low resistance). The patient is examined every few days as an outpatient until the condition resolves and instructed to return immediately with worsening signs or symptoms. NOTE: Medication noncompliance is an extremely common reason for recurrence or failure to improve. The oral antibiotic regimen should be individualized for ease of use and affordability. Effective generic alternatives to brand name antibiotics include doxycycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

It is of paramount importance to quickly rule out this etiology. SEE 7.3.1, ORBITAL CELLULITIS. • Dermoid and epidermoid cysts: Manifest clinically from birth to young adulthood and enlarge slowly. Preseptal dermoid cysts may become symptomatic in childhood and are most commonly found in the temporal upper eyelid or brow, and less often in the medial upper eyelid. The palpable, smooth mass may be mobile or fixed to the periosteum. Posterior dermoids typically become symptomatic in adulthood and may cause proptosis or globe displacement. Dermoid cyst rupture may mimic orbital cellulitis. B-scan US, when used, reveals a cystic lesion with good transmission of echoes. Because of the cystic configuration and specific signal properties, CT and MRI are usually diagnostic. SEE 14.3, MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING . Table 7.4.1.1 Childhood Orbital Lesions • Hemangioma of infancy (capillary hemangioma): Seen from birth to 2 years, generally show slowly progressive growth over the first 6 to 9 months with slow involution thereafter. May be observed through the eyelid as a bluish mass or be accompanied by a red hemangioma of the skin (strawberry nevus, stork bite), which blanches with pressure. Proptosis may be exacerbated by crying. It can enlarge over 6 to 12 months, but spontaneously regresses over the following several years. Not to be confused with the unrelated cavernous hemangioma of the orbit, typically seen in adults (See Figure 7.4.1.1 ). Table 7.4.1.2 CT and MRI Characteristics of Pediatric Orbital Lesions Figure 7.4.1.1 Capillary hemangioma. • Rhabdomyosarcoma: Average age of presentation is 8 to 10 years, but may occur from infancy to adulthood. May present with explosive proptosis, edema of the eyelids, a palpable eyelid lesion or subconjunctival mass, new-onset ptosis or strabismus, or a history of nosebleeds. Hallmarks are rapid onset and progression. Pain may occur in a minority of cases. Urgent biopsy is warranted if suspected. • Metastatic neuroblastoma: Seen during the first few years of life (usually by age 5 years). Abrupt presentation with unilateral or bilateral proptosis, eyelid ecchymosis, and globe displacement. The child is usually systemically ill, and 80% to 90% of patients presenting with orbital involvement already have a known history of neuroblastoma. Note that metastatic neuroblastoma may also present as an isolated Horner syndrome in a child. Prognosis decreases with age. • Lymphangioma: Usually seen in the first two decades of life with a slowly progressive course but may abruptly worsen if the tumor spontaneously bleeds. Proptosis may be intermittent and exacerbated by upper respiratory tract infections. Lymphangioma may present as an atraumatic eyelid ecchymosis. Concomitant conjunctival, eyelid, or oropharyngeal lymphangiomas may be noted (a conjunctival lesion appears as a multicystic mass). MRI is often diagnostic. B-scan US, when used, often reveals cystic spaces. See Figure 7.4.1.2 . Figure 7.4.1.2 T-2-weighted MRI of orbital lymphangioma with subacute blood cyst. • Optic nerve glioma (juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma): Usually first seen at age 2 to 6 years and is slowly progressive. Presentation includes painless axial proptosis with decreased visual acuity and a relative afferent pupillary defect. Optic nerve atrophy or swelling may be present. May be associated with neurofibromatosis (types I and II), in which case it may be bilateral. Prognosis decreases with chiasmal or hypothalamic involvement. SEE 13.13, PHAKOMATOSES. • Plexiform neurofibroma: Seen in the first decade of life and is pathognomonic for neurofibromatosis type I. Ptosis, eyelid hypertrophy, S-shaped deformity of the upper eyelid, or pulsating proptosis (from absence of the greater sphenoid wing) may be present.

Measure any proptosis (Hertel exophthalmometer) or globe displacement. Refer to a pediatrician for abdominal examination to rule out mass or organomegaly. \\3. Complete ocular examination, including visual acuity, pupillary assessment, color vision, IOP, refraction, and optic nerve evaluation. \\4.

Dermoid and epidermoid cysts: Complete surgical excision with the capsule intact. If the cyst ruptures, the contents can incite an acute inflammatory response. \\2. Infantile (capillary) hemangioma: Observe if not causing visual obstruction, astigmatism, and amblyopia. All capillary hemangiomas will eventually involute. In the presence of visual compromise (e.g., amblyopia, optic neuropathy) several treatment options exist: a. Systemic beta-blockers: While the exact mechanisms remains unclear, propranolol has become the preferred option in the treatment of refractory and rapidly proliferating capillary hemangiomas. Side effects of propranolol include hypoglycemia, hypotension, and bradycardia. Asthmatics and those with reactive airway disease are at risk of bronchospasm. Therefore, patients should be evaluated by a pediatrician pretreatment and monitored throughout the course of treatment. The initial dose of beta-blocker is typically given in conjunction with cardiopulmonary monitoring. Note that not all lesions respond to this therapy. b. Oral corticosteroids: Used less frequently since the introduction of beta-blockers. The dose is 2 to 3 mg/kg, tapered over 6 weeks. IOP must be monitored, and patients should be placed on GI prophylaxis. c. A local corticosteroid injection (e.g., betamethasone 6 mg/mL and triamcinolone 40 mg/mL) is rarely used. Care should be taken to avoid orbital hemorrhage and central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) during injection. Skin atrophy and depigmentation are other potential complications. Note that periocular injection of triamcinolone is contraindicated by the manufacturer because of the potential risk of embolic infarction. SEE NOTE IN 6.2, CHALAZION/HORDEOLUM. d. Surgical excision: If the hemangioma is circumscribed and accessible, excision can be performed effectively and is often curative. e. Interferon therapy: Usually reserved for large or systemic lesions that may be associated with a consumptive coagulopathy or high-output congestive heart failure (Kasabach–Merritt syndrome). There is a risk of spastic diplegia with this therapy. Not used frequently because of other viable alternatives, including propranolol. \\3. Rhabdomyosarcoma: Managed by urgent biopsy and referral to a pediatric oncologist in most cases. Local radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapy are given once the diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy and the patient has been appropriately staged. Significant orbital and ocular complications can occur even with prompt and aggressive management. Overall, the long-term prognosis for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma has greatly improved over the past 50 years due to advances in chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and exenteration is no longer the standard of care. Prognosis depends on subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma, location of lesion (orbital lesions have the best prognosis), and stage of disease. Note that prognosis for orbital lesions decreases with spread to adjacent anatomy (paranasal sinuses or intracranial vault). \\4. Lymphangioma: Most are managed by observation. Surgical debulking is performed for a significant cosmetic deformity, ocular dysfunction (e.g., strabismus and amblyopia), or compressive optic neuropathy from acute orbital hemorrhage, but may be difficult because of the infiltrative nature of the tumor. Incidence of hemorrhage into the lesion is increased after surgery. May recur after excision. Aspiration drainage of hemorrhagic cysts (“chocolate cysts”) may temporarily improve symptoms. Sclerosing therapy has become the most favorable approach to large lesions. \\5. Optic nerve glioma: Controversial. Observation, surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy are used variably on a case-by-case basis. \\6. Leukemia: Managed by a pediatric oncologist. Systemic chemotherapy for leukemia. Some physicians administer orbital radiation therapy alone in isolated orbital lesions (chloromas, granulocytic sarcomas), when systemic leukemia cannot be confirmed on bone marrow studies.","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/the_wills_eye/:686:0","tags":["eye"],"title":"The Wills Eye Manual","uri":"/en/the_wills_eye/"},{"categories":["eye"],"content":"Follow-Up \\1.

Cavernous hemangioma: Most common benign orbital mass in adults. Middle-aged women most commonly affected, with a slow onset of orbital signs. Growth may accelerate during pregnancy (See Figure 7.4.2.1 ). \\2. Mesenchymal tumors: Orbital lesions with varying degrees of aggressive behavior. The largest group is now labeled solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) and includes fibrous histiocytoma and hemangiopericytoma. These lesions cannot be distinguished clinically or radiographically. Occur at any age. \\3. Neurilemmoma (benign schwannoma): Progressive, painless proptosis. Rarely associated with neurofibromatosis type II. Malignant schwannoma has been reported but is rare. \\4. Neurofibroma: SEE 7.4.1, ORBITAL TUMORS IN CHILDREN. Table 7.4.2.2 CT and MRI Characteristics of Select Adult Extraconal Orbital Lesions Figure 7.4.2.1 T-2-weighted MRI of cavernous hemangioma. \\5. Meningioma: Optic nerve sheath meningioma (ONSM) typically occurs in middle-aged women with painless, slowly progressive visual loss, often with mild proptosis. An afferent pupillary defect may be present. Ophthalmoscopy can reveal optic nerve swelling, optic atrophy, or abnormal collateral vessels around the optic nerve head (optociliary shunts). \\6. Other optic nerve lesions: Optic nerve glioma, optic nerve sarcoid, malignant optic nerve glioma of adulthood (MOGA). The second most common lesion of the optic nerve (excluding optic neuritis) after ONSM is optic nerve sarcoid, which may be difficult to distinguish from ONSM clinically and radiologically. ACE level may be normal in cases of isolated optic nerve sarcoid. MOGA is a rapidly progressive optic nerve lesion of the elderly akin to glioblastoma multiforme; it carries a poor prognosis and is often misdiagnosed as a “progressive NAION.” \\7. Lymphangioma: Usually discovered in childhood. SEE 7.4.1, ORBITAL TUMORS IN CHILDREN. • Primarily Extraconal: \\1. Mucocele: Often presents with a frontal headache and a history of chronic sinusitis or sinus trauma. Usually located nasally or superonasally, emanating from the frontal and ethmoid sinuses. See Figure 7.4.2.2 . \\2. Localized neurofibroma: Occurs in young- to middle-aged adults with slow development of orbital signs. Eyelid infiltration results in an S-shaped upper eyelid. Some have neurofibromatosis type I, but most do not. \\3. SPA or spontaneous hematoma: SEE 7.3.2, SUBPERIOSTEAL ABSCESS. \\4. Dermoid cyst: SEE 7.4.1, ORBITAL TUMORS IN CHILDREN. \\5. Others: Tumors of the lacrimal gland (pleomorphic adenoma [well circumscribed], adenoid cystic carcinoma [ACC] [variably circumscribed with adjacent bone destruction]), sphenoid wing meningioma (commonly occurring in middle-aged females and a cause of compressive optic neuropathy), secondary tumors extending from the brain or paranasal sinuses, primary osseous tumors, and vascular lesions (e.g., varix, arteriovenous malformation). Figure 7.4.2.2 T-1-weighted MRI of a large frontoethmoidal mucocele. Note extension through left orbit and anterior cranial fossa with frontal lobe compression. • Intraconal or Extraconal: \\1. Lymphoproliferative disease (lymphoid hyperplasia and lymphoma): More commonly extraconal. About 50% are well circumscribed on imaging, 50% are infiltrative. Ocular adnexal lymphoma is typically of the non-Hodgkin B-cell type (NHL), and about 75% to 85% follow an indolent course (extranodal marginal zone lymphoma [EMZL] or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT] lymphoma, grade I or II follicular cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia [small cell lymphoma]). The remainder are aggressive lesions (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, among others). May occur at any adult age; orbital NHL is rare in children.

Classic lymphoma symptoms including fever, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss. \\2. Complete ocular examination, particularly visual acuity, pupillary response, ocular motility, dyschromatopsia testing, estimate of globe displacement and proptosis (Hertel exophthalmometer), IOP, optic nerve evaluation, and automated perimetry of each eye if concerned about an optic neuropathy. Examine conjunctival surface and cul-de-sacs carefully for salmon patches if lymphoma is suspected. \\3. CT (axial, coronal and parasagittal views) of the orbit and brain or orbital MRI with fat suppression/gadolinium, depending on suspected etiology and age. SEE 14.2 AND 14.3, COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY AND MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING. \\4. Orbital US with color Doppler imaging as needed to define the vascularity of the lesion. Conventional B-scan has a limited role in the diagnosis of orbital pathology because of the availability and resolution of CT and MRI, but may provide some data on anterior orbital lesions. \\5. When a metastasis is suspected and the primary tumor is unknown, the following should be performed: • Incisional biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, with estrogen receptor assay if breast carcinoma is suspected. • Breast examination and palpation of axillary lymph nodes by the primary physician. • Medical work-up (e.g., chest imaging, mammogram, prostate examination and prostate specific antigen testing, colonoscopy). • If the patient has a known history of metastatic cancer and is either a poor surgical candidate or has an orbital lesion that is difficult to access, empiric therapy for the orbital metastasis is a reasonable option. \\6. If lymphoproliferative disease (lymphoma or lymphoid hyperplasia) is suspected, biopsy for definitive diagnosis is indicated. Include adequate fixed tissue (for permanent sectioning and immunohistochemistry) and fresh tissue (for flow cytometry). If lymphoproliferative disease is confirmed, the systemic work-up is almost identical for polyclonal (lymphoid hyperplasia) and monoclonal (lymphoma) lesions (e.g., CBC with differential, serum protein electrophoresis, lactate dehydrogenase, and whole-body imaging [CT/MRI or positron emission tomography/CT]). Bone marrow biopsy may be indicated in certain forms of lymphoma. Close surveillance with serial clinical examination and systemic imaging is indicated over several years in all patients with lymphoproliferative disease, regardless of clonality. A significant percentage of patients initially diagnosed with orbital lymphoid hyperplasia will eventually develop systemic lymphoma. ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/the_wills_eye/:692:0","tags":["eye"],"title":"The Wills Eye Manual","uri":"/en/the_wills_eye/"},{"categories":["eye"],"content":"Treatment \\1. Metastatic disease: Systemic chemotherapy as required for the primary malignancy. Radiation therapy is often used for palliation of the orbital mass; high-dose radiation therapy may result in ocular and optic nerve damage. Hormonal therapy may be indicated in certain cases (e.g., breast, prostate carcinoma). Carcinoid tumors are occasionally completely resected with no additional therapy. \\2. Well-circumscribed lesions: Complete surgical excision is performed when there is compromised visual function, diplopia, rapid growth, or high suspicion of malignancy. Excision for cosmesis can be offered if the patient is willing to accept the surgical risks. An asymptomatic patient can be followed every 6 to 12 months with serial examinations and imaging. Progression of symptoms and rapidly increasing size on serial imaging are indications for exploration and biopsy/excision. \\3. Mucocele: Systemic antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin/sulbactam 3 g i.v. q6h) followed by surgical drainage of the mucocele, usually by transnasal endoscopic technique. Orbitotomy for excision is usually unnecessary and contraindicated as disruption of the mucocele’s mucosal lining may lead to recurrent, loculated lesions. \\4. Lymphoid tumors: Lymphoid hyperplasia and lymphoma without systemic involvement are treated almost identically. With few exceptions, orbital lymphoproliferations respond dramatically to relatively low doses of radiation; ocular and optic nerve complications are therefore more rare than with other malignancies. Systemic lymphoma is treated with chemotherapy and in many cases with biologics (e.g., rituximab). The majority of orbital lymphoma is of B-cell origin, and 50% to 60% are of the MALT subtype, presently called EMZL. In older individuals with few symptoms and indolent lesions, more conservative measures may be indicated, including observation alone or brief courses of corticosteroids. To date, there is no clear role for the use of systemic antibiotics in the treatment of orbital lymphoproliferative disease except possibly in certain geographic locations. There is also no clear evidence that orbital EMZL is in any way related to Helicobacter pylori-associated gastric EMZL. Remember that the specific subtype of NHL and its level of aggressiveness define the ultimate treatment, regardless of whether the lesion is localized to the orbit or related to systemic disease. \\5. ONSM: The diagnosis is usually based on slow progression and typical MRI findings. MRI with gadolinium is the preferred imaging modality. CT is occasionally helpful in demonstrating intralesional calcifications. Stereotactic radiation therapy is usually indicated when the tumor is growing and causing significant visual loss. Otherwise, the patient may be followed every 3 to 6 months with serial clinical examinations and imaging studies as needed. Recent studies have shown significant efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy in decreasing tumor growth and in visual preservation. Stereotactic radiotherapy is not equivalent to gamma knife therapy (“radiosurgery”). Empiric stereotactic radiotherapy (i.e., without confirmatory biopsy) is a reasonable treatment option, but is reserved for typical cases of ONSM. Atypical or rapidly progressive lesions still require biopsy. \\6. Localized neurofibroma: Surgical removal is performed for symptomatic and enlarging tumors. Excision may be difficult and incomplete in infiltrating neurofibromas. \\7. Neurilemmoma: Same as for cavernous hemangioma (see above). \\8. Mesenchymal tumors (including SFT, fibrous histiocytoma, and hemangiopericytoma): Complete excision when possible. The lesion may be fixed to the surrounding normal anatomy and abut critical structures. In such cases, debulking is reasonable, with long-term follow-up and serial imaging to rule out aggressive recurrence or potential malignant transformation. Notoriously difficult to prognosticate.

Typically painless. May have concomitant lung, skin, or renal disease. Lymphadenopathy, parotid gland enlargement, or seventh nerve palsy may be present. Of note, intraocular involvement is uncommon in patients with adnexal sarcoidal inflammation, and vice versa. More common in American blacks, West Africans, and white Northern Europeans. • IOIS: SEE 7.2.2, IDIOPATHIC ORBITAL INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME. Chronic, painless lacrimal gland enlargement is atypical for IOIS. • IgG4-related dacryoadenitis. SEE NOTE IN 7.2.2, IGG4-RELATED ORBITOPATHY. • Infectious: Enlarged palpebral lobe with surrounding conjunctival injection. Purulent discharge with bacterial dacryoadenitis, which is much less common than noninfectious dacryoadenitis. Bilateral lacrimal gland enlargement may be seen in patients with viral illnesses. CT scan may show fat stranding, abscess. • Benign mixed tumor (pleomorphic adenoma): Slowly progressive, painless proptosis or inferomedial displacement of the globe in middle-aged adults. Usually involves the orbital lobe of the lacrimal gland. CT may show a well-circumscribed mass with pressure-induced remodeling and enlargement of the lacrimal gland fossa. No true bony erosion occurs. • Lymphoproliferative tumor: Slowly progressive proptosis and globe displacement in an adult. May have a pink “salmon-patch” area of subconjunctival extension. CT usually shows a lacrimal gland lesion that conforms to the native anatomy, is well circumscribed, and does not erode bone. Bony erosion may be seen in aggressive histopathology (e.g., diffuse large B-cell and mantle cell lymphoma). Figure 7.6.1. MRI of right lacrimal gland adenoid cystic carcinoma. • ACC: Subacute onset of pain over 1 to 3 months, proptosis, and diplopia, with variable progression. Globe displacement, ptosis, and a motility disturbance are common. This malignant lesion often exhibits perineural invasion, resulting in pain and intracranial extension. CT shows an irregular mass, often with bony erosion (See Figure 7.6.1 ). • Malignant mixed epithelial tumor (pleomorphic adenocarcinoma): Occurs primarily in elderly patients, acutely producing pain and progressing rapidly. Usually develops within a long-standing benign mixed epithelial tumor (“carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma”), or secondarily, as a recurrence of a previously resected benign mixed tumor. CT findings are similar to those for ACC. • Lacrimal gland cyst (dacryops): Usually an asymptomatic mass that may fluctuate in size. Typically occurs in a young adult or middle-aged patient. • Others (may not involve the lacrimal gland, but occur superolaterally in the area of the lacrimal gland and fossa): GPA (Wegener granulomatosis), tuberculosis, leukemia, mumps, mononucleosis, syphilis (exceedingly rare), mucoepidermoid carcinoma, plasmacytoma, eosinophilic granuloma, metastasis. A dermoid cyst is typically a painless, subcutaneous cystic mass that enlarges slowly in the superolateral orbit. Anterior lesions manifest in childhood, while more posterior lesions hide effectively into adulthood. May rarely rupture, causing acute swelling and inflammation. Well-defined, cystic, extraconal mass noted on CT. Specific signal characteristics are seen on MRI (See Tables 7.4.1.2 and 14.3.2 ).

History: Determine the duration of the abnormality and rate of progression. Associated pain, tenderness, double vision? Weakness, weight loss, fever, or other signs of systemic malignancy? Breathing difficulty, skin rash, or history of uveitis (sarcoidosis)? Any known medical problems? Prior lacrimal gland biopsy or surgery? \\2. Complete ocular examination: Specifically look for keratic precipitates, iris nodules, posterior synechiae, and old retinal periphlebitis from sarcoidosis. As noted, intraocular sarcoidosis is uncommon in patients with ocular adnexal sarcoidosis, but may occur. \\3. Orbital CT (axial, coronal and parasagittal views): MRI is rarely required unless intracranial extension is suspected. CT is helpful in defining bony anatomy and abnormality. \\4. Consider a chest CT, which may diagnose sarcoidosis, primary malignancy, lymphoproliferative disease, metastatic disease, and, rarely, tuberculosis. \\5. Consider CBC with differential, ACE, cANCA, pANCA, SPEP, LDH, IgG4/IgG levels, and purified protein derivative (PPD) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) (e.g., QuantiFERON-TB Gold) if clinical history suggests a specific etiology. In most cases, ACE and LDH suffice. \\6. Lacrimal gland biopsy (see Note below) is indicated when a malignant tumor is suspected, or if the diagnosis is uncertain. If possible, avoid treatment with corticosteroids until biopsy is obtained. \\7. Systemic work-up by an internist or hematologist/oncologist when lymphoma is confirmed (e.g., abdominal and head CT scan, PET/CT scan, possible bone marrow biopsy). NOTE: Do not perform an incisional biopsy on lesions thought to be benign mixed tumors or dermoid cysts. Incomplete excision of a benign mixed tumor may lead to a recurrence with or without malignant transformation. Rupture of a dermoid cyst may lead to a severe inflammatory reaction. These two lesions should be completely excised without violating the capsule or pseudocapsule. NOTE: If ACC is suspected, avoid large, debulking biopsies. A recent study on the treatment of ACC with an intra-arterial chemotherapeutic protocol concluded that efficacy is compromised if the lacrimal artery is not intact. To avoid iatrogenic injury to the artery, perform an anterior biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of ACC.

Intracranial disease. Extension of intracranial tumors, usually frontal lobe or sphenoid wing meningiomas, may present with proptosis in addition to cranial neuropathy and decreased vision. Imaging, preferably with MRI, is indicated. \\2. Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) (e.g., carotid–cavernous or dural sinus fistula): AVF is either spontaneous, indirect (usually in older patients, Barrow type B-D) or posttraumatic, direct (in younger patients, Barrow type A). A bruit is sometimes heard by the patient and may be detected if ocular auscultation is performed. Pulsating proptosis, arterialized “corkscrew” conjunctival vessels, increased IOP, retinal venous congestion, and chemosis may be present. May mimic orbital disease, including TED and IOIS. In early stages, often misdiagnosed as conjunctivitis, asymmetric glaucoma, etc. CT scan reveals enlarged superior ophthalmic vein, sometimes accompanied by enlarged extraocular muscles. Orbital color Doppler US shows reversed, arterialized flow in superior ophthalmic vein. MRA or CTA may reveal AVF but definitive diagnosis usually requires arteriography. Evidence of posterior cortical venous outflow on arteriography increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Of note, posterior cortical venous outflow is more common in patients with bilateral orbital signs and is uncommonly seen in patients with unilateral presentation. Also remember that arteriography must be performed on both cerebral hemispheres and include the internal carotid, external carotid, and basilar arteries (“six vessel angio”). The cavernous sinuses are connected by the circular sinus and, on occasion, a carotid–cavernous fistula manifests clinically in the contralateral orbit. \\3. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis: Orbital cellulitis signs, plus dilated and sluggish pupils as well as palsies of the third, fourth, fifth, and/or sixth cranial nerves out of proportion to the degree of orbital edema. Decreasing level of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, and fevers can occur. May be bilateral with rapid progression. SEE 7.3.1, ORBITAL CELLULITIS. \\4. Orbital vasculitis (e.g., GPA, polyarteritis nodosa): Systemic signs and symptoms of vasculitis (especially sinus, renal, pulmonary, and skin disease), fever, markedly increased ESR, positive cANCA or pANCA. Of note, cANCA may be normal in 2/3 of patients with the limited sino-orbital variant of GPA. \\5. Varix: A large, dilated vein in the orbit that produces proptosis when it fills and dilates (e.g., during a Valsalva maneuver or with the head in a dependent position). When the vein is not engorged, the proptosis disappears. CT demonstrates the dilated vein if an enhanced scan is performed during a Valsalva maneuver. Calcification may be seen in long-standing lesions. \\6. Poorly understood processes: • Tolosa–Hunt syndrome (THS): NOT equivalent to orbital apical IOIS. Histopathologically, a granulomatous inflammation of the orbital apex and/or carotid siphon within the cavernous sinus. Presents with acute pain, cranial neuropathy, and sometimes proptosis. A diagnosis of exclusion. Difficult to diagnose with CT. MRI shows isolated, ipsilateral enlargement of the cavernous sinus. Usually sensitive to corticosteroid therapy, but pain typically responds much more quickly than external ophthalmoplegia, which may take weeks to resolve. Because confirmatory biopsy is usually not feasible, every patient with presumed THS must be followed long-term, even after rapid response to corticosteroids, to rule out other etiologies. Repeat imaging is usually indicated several months after the initial event to rule out progression. Presumed THS recurs in about 1/3 of patients. Remember that other significant pathologies, including sarcoidosis, lymphoma, metastasis, and even aneurysm may show a temporary response to corticosteroids. • Sclerosing orbital pseudotumor: Likely not a true orbital inflammation and certainly not a subt","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/the_wills_eye/:700:0","tags":["eye"],"title":"The Wills Eye Manual","uri":"/en/the_wills_eye/"},{"categories":["eye"],"content":"Definition A white pupillary reflex (See Figure 8.1.1 ).

Iris neovascularization is common. Pseudohypopyon and vitreous seeding may occur. Cataract is uncommon, and the eye is normal in size. May be bilateral, unilateral, or multifocal. Diagnosis is usually made in patients under 5 years of age, with a mean age of 18 months. A family history may be elicited in about 10%. • Toxocariasis: A nematode infection that may appear as a localized, white, elevated granuloma in the retina or as a diffuse endophthalmitis. Associated with localized inflammation of ocular structures, vitreous traction bands and related macular dragging, traction retinal detachment, and cataract. It is rarely bilateral and is usually diagnosed between 6 months and 10 years of age. Paracentesis of the anterior chamber may reveal eosinophils; serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for Toxocara organisms is positive. The patient may have a history of contact with puppies or of eating dirt. Toxocariasis may also be acquired prenatally and present as a congenital infection. Figure 8.1.1. Leukocoria. • Coats disease (See Figure 8.1.2 ): A retinal vascular abnormality resulting in small multifocal outpouchings of the retinal vessels. Leukocoria may develop secondary to an exudative, often bullous retinal detachment associated with lipid-rich subretinal fluid or to extensive, yellow intraretinal and subretinal exudate. Usually develops in boys during the first decade of life; more severe cases occur in early childhood. Coats disease is rarely bilateral. No family history. • Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV) (previously known as persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous [PHPV]): A developmental ocular abnormality consisting of a varied degree of glial and vascular proliferation in the vitreous cavity. It is usually associated with a slightly small eye; can also be seen in an eye of normal size or, in cases associated with glaucoma, an enlarged eye. Typically there is a membrane behind the lens that may place inward traction on the ciliary processes. This is a progressive condition with a cataract present at birth or early in life. The membrane and lens may rotate anteriorly, shallowing the anterior chamber and resulting in secondary glaucoma. Retinal detachments may be seen. Rarely bilateral. No family history. Figure 8.1.2. Coats disease. • Pediatric cataract: Opacity of the lens present at birth; may be unilateral or bilateral. There may be a family history or an associated systemic disorder. SEE 8.8, PEDIATRIC CATARACT. • Retinal astrocytoma: A sessile to slightly elevated, yellow-white retinal mass that may be calcified and is often associated with tuberous sclerosis and rarely neurofibromatosis. May occur on the optic nerve head (giant drusen) in patients with tuberous sclerosis. • Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP): Predominantly occurs in premature children. Leukocoria is usually the result of a retinal detachment. SEE 8.2, RETINOPATHY OF PREMATURITY. • Others: Retinal detachment, retinochoroidal coloboma, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), myelinated nerve fibers, uveitis, toxoplasmosis, trauma, CMV retinitis, endophthalmitis, retinal dysplasia, incontinentia pigmenti, Norrie disease, medulloepithelioma.

A dilated fundus examination and anterior vitreous examination are essential. \\3. Any or all of the following may be helpful in diagnosis and planning treatment: • B-scan ultrasonography (US), especially if there is no view of the fundus. This can be used to look for calcification within a suspected lesion or a persistent stalk from the nerve to the back of the lens. • Intravenous fluorescein angiogram (useful for evaluation of Coats disease, ROP, retinoblastoma). • Computed tomographic (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit and brain, particularly for bilateral cases of retinoblastoma or those with a family history. Also advised in cases of advanced Coats disease. • Serum ELISA test for Toxocara (positive at 1:8 in the vast majority of infected patients). • Systemic evaluation by pediatrician, especially if concern for retinal astrocytoma or retinoblastoma. • Anterior chamber paracentesis and serum ELISA test for evaluation of toxocariasis (serum antibody test positive at 1:8 in the vast majority of patients infected with Toxocara).

Congenital (infantile) esotropia: Manifests by age 6 months. The angle of esodeviation is usually large (\u003e40- to 50-prism diopters) and mostly equal at distance and near fixation. Refractive error is usually normal for age (slightly hyperopic). Amblyopia is uncommon but may be present in those who do not cross-fixate. Prohibits development of binocular vision. Family history may be present but is not mandatory. Latent nystagmus, inferior oblique overaction, and dissociated vertical deviation may develop as late findings. Congenital esotropia can occur in up to 30% of children with neurologic and developmental disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus). Figure 8.4.2. Pseudoesotropia. \\2. Acquired nonaccommodative esotropia: Convergent misalignment of the eyes not corrected by hyperopic lenses that develops after 6 months of age. Typically starts as intermittent but can become constant over time. Esodeviation is comitant and usually smaller (20 to 35 prism diopters) than that seen in congenital esotropia. Patients may experience diplopia. May be the presenting sign of a brain tumor, however, in most cases there is no associated neurologic or neuroplastic disorder. Usually corrected with strabismus surgery once the angle of the esotropia becomes consistent. \\3. Accommodative esotropia: Convergent misalignment of the eyes associated with activation of the accommodative reflex. May present at 6 months to 6 years of age with the average age of onset being 2.5 years. Subtypes of accommodative esotropia: • Refractive accommodative esotropia: These children are hyperopic in the range of +3.00 to +10.00 diopters (average, +4.75). The measured angle of esodeviation is usually moderate (20- to 30-prism diopters) and is relatively equal at distance and near fixation. Full hyperopic correction eliminates the esodeviation. The accommodative convergence–accommodation angle ratio (AC/A) is normal. Amblyopia is common at presentation. • Nonrefractive accommodative esotropia (high AC/A ratio): The measured angle of esodeviation is greater at near fixation than at distance fixation. The refractive error may range from normal for age (slight hyperopia) to high hyperopia (may be seen in conjunction with refractive-type accommodative esotropia) or even myopia. Amblyopia is common. • Partial or decompensated accommodative esotropia: Refractive and nonrefractive accommodative esotropias that have a reduction in the esodeviation when given full hyperopic correction, but still have a residual esodeviation. When partial, the residual esodeviation is the nonaccommodative component. \\4. Sensory-deprivation esotropia: An esodeviation that occurs in a patient with a monocular or binocular condition that prevents good vision. \\5. Divergence insufficiency: A convergent ocular misalignment that is greater at distance fixation than at near fixation. This is a diagnosis of exclusion and must be differentiated from divergence paralysis, which, when sudden in onset, can be associated with pontine tumors, neurologic trauma, and elevated intracranial pressure.

However, prescribe glasses and initiate treatment of any underlying amblyopia prior to surgical intervention as appropriate. \\2. Accommodative esotropia: Glasses must be worn full time. a. If the patient is \u003c6 years, correct the hyperopia with the full cycloplegic refraction. b. If the patient is \u003e6 years, attempts should be made to give as close to the full-plus refraction as possible, knowing that some may not tolerate the full prescription. Attempts to push plus lenses during the manifest (noncycloplegic) refraction until distance vision blurs may be tried to give the most plus lenses without blurring distance vision. The goal of refractive correction should be straight alignment without sacrificing visual acuity. c. If the patient’s eyes are straight at distance with full correction, but still esotropic at near fixation (high AC/A ratio), treatment options include the following: • Bifocals (flat-top or executive type) +2.50 or +3.00 diopter add, with top of the bifocal at the lower pupillary border. • Extraocular muscle surgery targeting the near deviation only may be indicated. This typically requires posterior fixation sutures to the muscle to modify the surgical effect for near only. • Wearing full-plus distance glasses only.

If no changes are made and the eyes are straight, the patient should be followed several times a year when young, decreasing to annually when stable. \\3. When a residual esotropia is present while the patient wears glasses, an attempt is made to add more plus power to the current prescription. Children \u003c6 years should receive a new cycloplegic refraction; plus lenses are pushed without cycloplegia in older children. The maximal additional plus lens that does not blur distance vision is prescribed. If the eyes cannot be straightened with more plus power, then a decompensated accommodative esotropia has developed (SEE ABOVE IN SECTION 8.4, COMITANT OR CONCOMITANT ESOTROPIC DEVIATIONS). \\4. Hyperopia often decreases slowly after age 5 to 7 years, and the strength of the glasses may need to be reduced so as not to blur distance vision. If the strength of the glasses must be reduced to improve visual acuity and the esotropia returns, then this is a decompensated accommodative esotropia. 8.5 Exodeviations ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/the_wills_eye/:726:0","tags":["eye"],"title":"The Wills Eye Manual","uri":"/en/the_wills_eye/"},{"categories":["eye"],"content":"Signs (See Figure 8.5.1 .)

Exophoria: Exodeviation controlled by fusion under conditions of normal binocular vision. Usually asymptomatic, but prolonged strenuous visual activity may cause asthenopia. Figure 8.5.1. Exotropia. \\2. Intermittent exotropia: The most common type of exodeviation in children. Onset is usually before age 5. Frequency often increases over time. Amblyopia is rare. a. There are three phases: • Phase 1: One eye turns out at distance fixation, spontaneously or when it is covered. Usually occurs when the patient is fatigued, sick, or not attentive. The eyes become straight within one to two blinks or when the cover is removed. The eyes are straight at near fixation. Patient often closes one eye or squints in bright sunlight. This is likely due to dissociation and breakdown of their binocular alignment. • Phase 2: Increasing frequency of exotropia at distance fixation. Exophoria begins to occur at near fixation. • Phase 3: There is a constant exotropia at distance and near fixations. b. These phases can be seen in all four types of intermittent exotropia: • Basic: Exodeviation is approximately the same with distance and near fixation. • True divergence excess: Exodeviation that remains greater at distance than near after a period of monocular occlusion. • Simulated divergence excess: Exodeviation that is initially greater with distance fixation than near that becomes approximately the same after an interval of monocular occlusion. • Convergence insufficiency: Exodeviation is greater at near than distance. Distinct from isolated convergence insufficiency. SEE 13.4, CONVERGENCE INSUFFICIENCY. \\3. Constant exotropia: Encountered more often in older children. There are three types: • Congenital exotropia: Presents before age 6 months with a large angle deviation. Uncommon in otherwise healthy infants and may be associated with a central nervous system or craniofacial disorder. • Sensory-deprivation exotropia: An eye that does not see well for any reason may turn outward. • Consecutive exotropia: Follows previous surgery for esotropia. \\4. Duane syndrome, type 2: Limitation of adduction of one eye, with globe retraction and narrowing of the palpebral fissure on attempted adduction. Rarely bilateral. SEE 8.6, STRABISMUS SYNDROMES. \\5. Neuromuscular abnormalities: • Third nerve palsy: SEE 10.5, ISOLATED THIRD NERVE PALSY. • Myasthenia gravis: SEE 10.11, MYASTHENIA GRAVIS. • Internuclear ophthalmoplegia: SEE 10.13, INTERNUCLEAR OPHTHALMOPLEGIA. \\6. Dissociated horizontal deviation: A change in horizontal ocular alignment caused by a change in the balance of visual input from the two eyes. Not related to accommodation. Seen clinically as a spontaneous unilateral exodeviation or an exodeviation of greater magnitude in one eye during prism and alternate cover testing. \\7. Orbital disease (e.g., tumor, idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome): Proptosis and restriction of ocular motility are usually evident. SEE 7.1, ORBITAL DISEASE. \\8. Isolated convergence insufficiency: Usually occurs in patients \u003e10 years. Blurred near vision, asthenopia, or diplopia when reading. An exophoria at near fixation, but straight or small exophoria at distance fixation. Must be differentiated from convergence paralysis. SEE 13.4, CONVERGENCE INSUFFICIENCY. \\9. Convergence paralysis: Similar to convergence insufficiency, but with a relatively acute onset, an exotropia at near, and an inability to overcome base out prism.

The globe retracts and the eyelid fissure narrows on adduction. In unilateral cases, the strabismus will be incomitant and the patient will often adopt a face turn to allow them to use both eyes together. May be associated with deafness and limb or vertebral abnormalities. Classified into three types: • Type 1 (most common): Limited abduction. Primary position frequently esotropia. In unilateral cases, nearly always with face turn toward affected side. • Type 2 (least common): Limited adduction. Primary position usually exotropia. In unilateral cases, often with face turn away from affected side. • Type 3: Limited abduction and adduction. Esotropia, exotropia, or no primary position deviation. Significant globe retraction. • Brown syndrome: A motility disorder characterized by limitation of elevation in adduction. Elevation in abduction is normal. Typically, eyes are aligned in primary gaze, although a vertical diplopia with chin-up head position or face turn can be present. Usually congenital, but may be idiopathic or acquired secondary to trauma, surgery, or inflammation in the area of the trochlea. Bilateral in 10% of patients. • Monocular elevation deficiency (double elevator palsy): Congenital. Unilateral limitation of elevation in all fields of gaze secondary to restriction of the inferior rectus or paresis of the inferior oblique and/or superior rectus. There may be hypotropia of the involved eye that increases in upgaze. Ptosis or pseudoptosis may be present in primary gaze. The patient may assume a chin-up position to maintain fusion if a hypotropia in primary gaze is present. • Möbius syndrome: Rare congenital condition associated with both sixth and seventh nerve palsies. Esotropia is usually present. Limitation of abduction and/or adduction. A unilateral or bilateral facial nerve palsy is either partial or complete. Other cranial nerve palsies as well as deformities of the limbs, chest, and tongue may occur. • Congenital fibrosis syndrome: Congenital group of disorders with restriction and fibrous replacement of the extraocular muscles. Usually involves all of the extraocular muscles with total external ophthalmoplegia and ptosis. Usually both eyes are directed downward, so the patient assumes a chin-up position to see. Often autosomal dominant.

Patients younger than 12 years: • Appropriate spectacle correction (full cycloplegic refraction or reduce the hyperopia in both eyes symmetrically ≥1.50 diopters). If vision remains reduced after period of refractive adaptation (6 to 12 weeks), begin patching or penalization of fellow eye. • Patching: Patch the eye with better corrected vision 2 to 6 hours/day. Follow up visits should be scheduled for 1 week per year of age (e.g., 3 weeks for a 3 year old). Adhesive patches placed directly over the eye are most effective. Patches worn over glasses are not ideal due to the risk of children peeking. If a patch causes local irritation, use tincture of benzoin on the skin before applying the patch and use warm water compresses on the patch before removal. • Penalization with atropine: Atropine 1% once daily (used with glasses) has been shown to be equally effective as patching in mild-to-moderate amblyopia (20/100 or better). If vision does not improve, the effect of the atropine can be increased by removing the hyperopic lens from the glasses of the non-amblyopic eye. If the child is experiencing difficulty with school work with the use of atropine, he/she can wear full hyperopic correction with a +2.50 bifocal during school. • Optical degradation: Use a high plus lens (e.g., +9.00 diopters or an aphakic contact lens) to blur the image. If the child is highly myopic, may remove the minus lens from the preferred eye. \\2. Continue patching until the vision is equalized or shows no improvement after three compliant cycles of patching.

If occlusion amblyopia (a decrease in vision in the patched eye) develops, patch the opposite eye for a short period (e.g., 1 day per year of age), and repeat the examination. \\4. In strabismic amblyopia, delay strabismus surgery until the vision in the two eyes is equal, or maximal vision has been obtained in the amblyopic eye. \\5. If treatment of amblyopia fails or the patient presents outside of treatment age range, protective glasses should be worn to prevent accidental injury to the non-amblyopic eye.

Phenotype varies in terms of cataract morphology and timing of clinical onset. • Galactosemia: Cataract may be the sole manifestation when galactokinase deficiency is responsible. A deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase may produce mental retardation and symptomatic cirrhosis along with cataracts. The typical oil-droplet opacity may or may not be seen. Incidence and onset of cataract may vary according to type of galactosemia (i.e., mutation of uridyl transferase, galactokinase, or epimerase). Cataract may be reversible with appropriate dietary modifications. • PFV: Unilateral. The involved eye is usually slightly smaller than the normal fellow eye. Examination after pupil dilatation may reveal a plaque of fibrovascular tissue behind the lens with elongated ciliary processes extending to it. Progression of the lens opacity often leads to angle-closure glaucoma. • Rubella: “Pearly white” nuclear cataract, “salt-and-pepper” chorioretinitis, microphthalmos, corneal clouding, and poorly dilating pupils. Glaucoma may occur with congenital rubella but usually does not occur in the presence of a rubella cataract. Associated hearing defects and heart abnormalities are common. • Lowe syndrome (oculocerebrorenal syndrome): Opaque lens, congenital glaucoma, renal disease, and mental retardation. X-linked recessive. Patients’ mothers may have small cataracts. • Others: Intrauterine infection, chromosomal disorders, aniridia, systemic syndromes, metabolic abnormalities, and anterior segment dysgenesis. • Acquired: Trauma, drugs, metabolic/endocrine abnormalities, radiation.

A blunted retinoscopic reflex suggests the cataract is visually significant. Cataracts ≥3 mm in diameter usually but not always affect vision. Cataracts ≤3 mm may not be inherently visually significant but have been associated with amblyopia secondary to induced anisometropia.

Other malformations may also be seen (See Figure 8.12.2 ). • Microspherophakia: The lens is small and spherical in configuration. It can subluxate into the anterior chamber, causing a secondary glaucoma. Can be isolated or seen in association with Weill–Marchesani syndrome (See Figure 8.12.3 ). • Anterior and posterior lenticonus: An anterior or posterior ectasia of the lens surface, posterior occurring more commonly than anterior. Often associated with cataract. Unilateral or bilateral. Anterior lenticonus is associated with Alport syndrome. Posterior lenticonus is usually isolated and may be autosomal dominant, but can also be seen with Alport syndrome. Figure 8.12.2. Peters anomaly. Figure 8.12.3. Microspherophakia. • Ectopia lentis: SEE 13.10, SUBLUXED OR DISLOCATED CRYSTALLINE LENS. • Ectopia lentis et pupillae: Lens displacement associated with pupillary displacement in the opposite direction. Usually not associated with glaucoma. • Aniridia: Bilateral, near-total absence of the iris. Glaucoma, macular hypoplasia with poor vision, nystagmus, refractive error, and corneal pannus are common. Aniridia is autosomal dominant in two-thirds of patients, a type usually without systemic implications. It occurs sporadically in one-third of cases. May be part of a panocular disorder due to mutations in the master control gene of the eye, PAX6. If PAX6 is deleted as part of a larger chromosomal deletion it is called WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genital abnormalities, retardation). Children with sporadic aniridia have about a 30% chance of Wilms tumor development and require screening. • Sclerocornea: Nonprogressive scleralization of the cornea. Unilateral or bilateral. May be mild and peripheral or severe and diffuse. Associated with severe anterior segment dysgenesis and risk for glaucoma. Often associated with microphthalmia. • Primary aphakia: Failure of lens development. Usually associated with microphthalmia and severe intraocular dysgenesis including retinal dysplasia and corneal opacity. High risk for glaucoma.

SEE 8.12, DEVELOPMENTAL ANTERIOR SEGMENT AND LENS ANOMALIES/DYSGENESIS. • Albinism: Iris transillumination defects and foveal hypoplasia. SEE 13.8, ALBINISM. NOTE: Ocular abnormalities in patients with albinism and aniridia may be subtle and difficult to assess during an office evaluation. • Optic nerve hypoplasia: Small optic discs can be difficult to detect when bilateral. When present, a “double-ring” sign (a pigmented ring at the inner and outer edge of a peripapillary scleral ring) is diagnostic. If unilateral, may be seen with strabismus, a relative afferent pupillary defect, and unilateral poor fixation instead of searching nystagmus. Usually idiopathic. NOTE: Bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia is occasionally associated with septo-optic dysplasia (formerly known as de Morsier syndrome). In contrast, unilateral optic nerve hypoplasia is only rarely associated with this syndrome. Septo-optic dysplasia includes midline abnormalities of the brain as well as growth, thyroid, and other trophic hormone deficiencies. Growth retardation, seizures as a result of hypoglycemia, and diabetes insipidus may develop. If bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia is present, obtain an MRI with attention to the hypothalamic-pituitary area. If unilateral optic nerve hypoplasia is present, imaging studies may be considered as clinically relevant. • Congenital optic atrophy: Rare. Pale, normal-sized optic disc, often associated with mental retardation or cerebral palsy. Normal electroretinogram (ERG). Autosomal recessive or sporadic. • Shaken baby syndrome: Multilayered retinal hemorrhages often associated with subdural/subarachnoid hemorrhage. SEE 3.21, SHAKEN BABY SYNDROME. • Extreme refractive error: Diagnosed on cycloplegic refraction. • Congenital motor nystagmus: Patients with this condition usually have a mild visual deficit (20/60 or better). Binocular conjugate horizontal nystagmus. More than one type of nystagmus may be present, including jerk, pendular, circular, or elliptical.

Autosomal recessive. • Congenital stationary night blindness: Visual acuity may be close to normal, nystagmus less common, associated with myopia. ERG is abnormal. Autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked forms exist. Often have paradoxical pupillary response (pupillary constriction in dim light after exposure to bright light). Retinal pigmentary abnormalities are seen in some types of congenital stationary night blindness. • Achromatopsia (rod monochromatism): Vision is in the 20/200 range. Marked photophobia. Pupils react normally to light but may have paradoxical pupillary response. Normal fundus, but photopic ERG is markedly attenuated. Absence of response to flicker light stimulus (25 Hz) is diagnostic. Scotopic ERG is normal. • Cortical visual impairment: One of the most common causes of visual impairment in children from developed countries. Vision is variable. Although the ocular examination is normal, there is an underlying neurologic deficiency causing decreased visual responses. • Diffuse cerebral dysfunction: Infants do not respond to sound or touch and are neurologically abnormal. Vision may slowly improve with time. • Delayed maturation of the visual system: Normal response to sound and touch and neurologically normal.

No peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS). • Optic nerve: See Figure 9.1.1 . Characteristic appearance includes loss of rim tissue (includes notching; increased and/or progressive narrowing most commonly inferiorly followed by superiorly, more rarely nasally or temporally), splinter or nerve fiber layer hemorrhage that crosses the disc margin (Drance hemorrhage), acquired pit, nerve fiber layer defect, cup/disc (C/D) asymmetry \u003e0.2 in the absence of a cause (e.g., anisometropia, different nerve sizes), bayoneting (sharp angulation of the blood vessels as they exit the nerve), enlarged C/D ratio (\u003e0.6; less specific), progressive enlargement of the cup, greater Disc Damage Likelihood Scale (DDLS) score (See Figure 9.1.2 ).

SEE 9.3, OCULAR HYPERTENSION. • Physiologic optic nerve cupping: Static enlarged C/D ratio without rim notching or visual field loss. Usually normal IOP and large optic nerve (\u003e about 2 mm). Often familial. • Secondary open angle glaucoma: Identifiable cause for open angle glaucoma including inflammatory, exfoliative, pigmentary, steroid-induced, angle recession, traumatic (as a result of direct injury, blood, or debris), and glaucoma related to increased episcleral venous pressure (e.g., Sturge–Weber syndrome, carotid–cavernous fistula), intraocular tumors, degenerated red blood cells (ghost cell glaucoma), lens-induced, degenerated photoreceptor outer segments following chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (Schwartz–Matsuo syndrome), or developmental anterior segment abnormalities. Figure 9.1.2 Disc Damage Likelihood Scale. • Low tension glaucoma: Same as primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) except normal IOP. SEE 9.2, LOW TENSION PRIMARY OPEN ANGLE GLAUCOMA (NORMAL PRESSURE GLAUCOMA). • Previous glaucomatous damage (e.g., from steroids, uveitis, glaucomatocyclitic crisis, trauma) in which the inciting agent has been removed. Nerve appearance now static. • Optic atrophy: Characterized by disproportionally more optic nerve pallor than cupping. IOP usually normal unless a secondary or unrelated glaucoma is present. Color vision and central vision are often decreased. Causes include tumors of the optic nerve, chiasm, or tract; syphilis, ischemic optic neuropathy, drugs, retinal vascular or degenerative disease, others. Visual field defects that respect the vertical midline are typical of intracranial lesions localized at the chiasm or posterior to it. • Congenital optic nerve defects (e.g., tilted discs, colobomas, optic nerve pits): Visual field defects may be present but are static. • Optic nerve drusen: Optic nerves not usually cupped and drusen often visible. Visual field defects may remain stable or progress unrelated to IOP. The most frequent defects include arcuate defects or an enlarged blind spot. Characteristic calcified lesions can be seen on B-scan ultrasonography (US) (as well as on computed tomography [CT]). Autofluorescence can also highlight nerve drusen.

Figure 9.1.3. Humphrey visual field (HVF) showing a superior arcuate defect or scotoma of the left eye. \\2. Baseline glaucoma evaluation: All patients with suspected glaucoma of any type should have the following: • Complete ocular examination including visual acuity, pupillary assessment for a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), confrontational visual fields, slit lamp examination, applanation tonometry, gonioscopy, and dilated fundus examination (if the angle is open) with special attention to the optic nerve. Color vision testing is indicated if any suspicion of a neurologic disorder. • Baseline documentation of the optic nerves. May include meticulous drawings, stereoscopic disc photos, red-free photographs, and/or computerized image analysis (e.g., optical coherence tomography [OCT] or Heidelberg retina tomography [HRT]) (See Figure 9.1.4 ). • Formal visual field testing (e.g.,Humphrey automated visual field). Goldmann visual field tests may be helpful in patients unable to take the automated tests adequately. • Measure central corneal thickness (CCT). Corneal thickness variations affect apparent IOP as measured with applanation tonometry. Average corneal thickness is 535 to 545 microns. Thinner corneas tend to underestimate IOP, whereas thicker corneas tend to overestimate IOP. Of note, the relationship between corneal thickness and measured IOP is not exactly linear. A thin CCT is an independent risk factor for the development of POAG. Figure 9.1.4. Optical coherence tomography of the optic nerve head (ONH) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. • Evaluation for other causes of optic nerve damage should be considered when any of the following atypical features are present: • Optic nerve pallor out of proportion to the degree of cupping. • Visual field defects greater than expected based on amount of cupping. • Visual field patterns not typical of glaucoma (e.g., defects respecting the vertical midline, hemianopic defects, enlarged blind spot, central scotoma). • Unilateral progression despite equal IOP in both eyes. • Decreased visual acuity out of proportion to the amount of cupping or field loss. • Color vision loss, especially in the red–green axis. *If any of these are present, further evaluation may include:* • History: Acute episodes of eye pain or redness? Steroid use? Acute visual loss? Ocular trauma? Surgery, systemic trauma, heart attack, dialysis, or other event that may lead to hypotension? • Diurnal IOP curve consisting of multiple IOP checks during the course of the day. • Consider other laboratory work-up for nonglaucomatous optic neuropathy: Heavy metals, vitamin B12/folate, angiotensin-converting enzyme, antinuclear antibody, Lyme antibody, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) or treponemal-specific assay (e.g., MHA-TP). If giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a consideration, check erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and platelets ([SEE 10.17, ARTERITIC ISCHEMIC OPTIC NEUROPATHY GIANT CELL ARTERITIS ]). • In cases where a neurologic disorder is suspected, obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with gadolinium and fat suppression if no contraindications present. • Check blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c, lipid panel, and CBC (screening for anemia).

Who to treat? The decision to treat must be individualized. Some general guidelines are suggested. *Is the glaucomatous process present?* Damage is present if the DDLS score is \u003e5 (See Figure 9.1.2 ) or there is visual field loss, the presence of an acquired pit or notched rims, IOP higher than 34 mm Hg, and/or IOP asymmetry more than 10 mm Hg. *Is the glaucomatous process active?* Determine the rate of damage progression by careful follow-up. Certain causes of cupping may be static (e.g., prior steroid response). Disc hemorrhages suggest active disease. *Is the glaucomatous process likely to cause disability?* Consider the patient’s age, overall physical and social health, as well as an estimation of his or her life expectancy. \\2. What is the treatment goal? The goal of treatment is to enhance or maintain the patient’s health by halting optic nerve damage while avoiding undue side effects of treatment. The only proven method of stopping or slowing optic nerve damage is reducing IOP. Reduction of IOP by at least 30% appears to have the best chance of preventing optic nerve damage. An optimal goal may be to reduce the IOP at least 30% below the threshold of progression. If damage is severe, greater reduction in IOP may be necessary. \\3. How to treat? The main treatment options for glaucoma include medications, laser trabeculoplasty (LT) (both argon [ALT] and selective [SLT]), and glaucoma surgery. Typically, medications are first-line therapy. Often ALT and SLT are also appropriate initial therapies, especially in patients at risk for poor compliance, with medication side effects, and who have significant trabecular meshwork (TM) pigmentation. Surgery may be appropriate initial treatment if damage is advanced in the setting of a rapid rate of progression or difficult follow-up. Options include glaucoma filtering surgery (e.g., trabeculectomy), tube shunt procedures, laser cyclophotocoagulation of the ciliary body (e.g., with diode laser or endolaser), and cyclocryotherapy. Surgery should always be considered for any patient with advanced/progressive disease or IOP uncontrolled by other methods. NOTE: Microinvasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) encompasses newer surgical options that offer the advantage of fewer complications and shorter healing times. MIGS should only be considered for patients with mild-to-moderate glaucoma. Some MIGS procedures include canaloplasty, deep sclerectomy, iStent trabecular micro-bypass, endocyclophotocoagulation, and trabectome trabecular ablation.

[preservative free]) are to be used with caution in patients with active uveitis or cystoid macular edema (CME) and are contraindicated in pregnant women or in women wishing to become pregnant. Inform patients of potential pigment changes in iris and periorbital skin, as well as hypertrichosis of eyelashes. Irreversible iris pigment changes rarely occur in blue or dark brown eyes; those at highest risk for iris hyperpigmentation have hazel, grey irides. • Beta-blockers (e.g., levobunolol or timolol 0.25% to 0.5% daily or b.i.d.) should be avoided in patients with asthma, COPD, heart block, bradyarrhythmia, unstable congestive heart failure, depression, or myasthenia gravis. In addition to bronchospasm and bradycardia, other side effects include hypotension, decreased libido, CNS depression, and reduced exercise tolerance. • Selective α2-receptor agonists (brimonidine 0.1%, 0.15%, or 0.2% b.i.d. to t.i.d.) are contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (risk of hypertensive crisis) and relatively contraindicated in children under the age of 5 (risk for cardiorespiratory and CNS depression). SEE 8.11, CONGENITAL/INFANTILE GLAUCOMA. Apraclonidine 0.5% or 1% may be used for short-term therapy (3 months), but tends to lose effectiveness and has a high allergy rate. • Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) (e.g., dorzolamide 2% or brinzolamide 1% b.i.d. to t.i.d.) should be avoided, but are not contraindicated, in patients with sulfa allergy. These medications theoretically could cause the same side effects as systemic CAIs, such as metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, gastrointestinal symptoms, weight loss, paresthesias, and aplastic anemia. However, systemic symptoms from topical CAIs are extremely rare. There have been no reported cases of aplastic anemia from topical use. Corneal endothelial dysfunction may be exacerbated with topical CAIs; these medications should be used cautiously in patients with Fuchs corneal dystrophy and post keratoplasty. • Miotics (e.g., pilocarpine q.i.d.) are usually used in low strengths initially (e.g., 1% to 2%) and then built up to higher strengths (e.g., 4%). Commonly not tolerated in patients \u003c40 years because of accommodative spasm. Miotics are usually contraindicated in patients with retinal holes and should be used cautiously in patients at risk for retinal detachment (e.g., high myopes and aphakes). NOTE: Pilocarpine is not routinely used at Wills Eye due to its adverse side effect profile including associated increased risk for uveitis and retinal detachment, possibility for miosis-induced angle closure, and symptoms such as headache. • Sympathomimetics (dipivefrin 0.1% b.i.d. or epinephrine 0.5% to 2.0% b.i.d.) rarely reduce IOP to the degree of the other drugs, but have few systemic side effects (rarely, cardiac arrhythmias). They often cause red eyes and may cause CME in aphakic patients. • Systemic CAIs (e.g., methazolamide 25 to 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. to t.i.d., acetazolamide 125 to 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. to q.i.d., or acetazolamide 500 mg sequel p.o. b.i.d.) are relatively contraindicated in patients with renal failure. Potassium levels must be monitored if the patient is taking other diuretic agents or digitalis. Side effects such as fatigue, nausea, confusion, and paresthesias are common. Rare, but severe, hematologic side effects (e.g., aplastic anemia) and Stevens–Johnson syndrome have occurred. Allergy to sulfa drugs is not an absolute contraindication to the use of systemic CAIs, but extra caution should be exercised in monitoring for an allergic reaction.","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/the_wills_eye/:787:2","tags":["eye"],"title":"The Wills Eye Manual","uri":"/en/the_wills_eye/"},{"categories":["eye"],"content":"*Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty* In some patients, as previously defined, ALT may be used as first-line therapy.

Aphakic or pseudophakic pupillary block or secondary closure of the angle: Do not use pilocarpine. Consider a mydriatic and a cycloplegic agent (e.g., cyclopentolate 1% to 2%, and phenylephrine 2.5% every 15 minutes for four doses) when laser or surgery cannot be performed because of corneal edema, inflammation, or both. c. Topiramate- or sulfonamide-induced secondary angle closure: Do not use CAIs in sulfonamide-induced angle closure. Immediately discontinue the inciting medication. Consider cycloplegia to induce posterior rotation of the ciliary body (e.g., atropine 1% b.i.d. or t.i.d.). Consider hospitalization and treatment with intravenous hyperosmotic agents and intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone 250 mg i.v. every 6 hours) for cases of markedly elevated IOP unresponsive to other treatments.

Mechanisms for glaucoma in dislocated/subluxed lenses include an inflammatory reaction caused by the lens material itself, pupillary block, or damage to the anterior chamber angle sustained during trauma. A dislocated lens may become hypermature and cause a phacolytic glaucoma (SEE 9.12.1, PHACOLYTIC GLAUCOMA ). In addition, a dislocated or subluxed lens can lead to phacoanaphylaxis if associated with capsule violation (SEE 9.12.3, PHACOANAPHYLAXIS ). Pupillary block is the most common mechanism and can occur secondary to anterior displacement of the lens or to vitreous plugging the pupil. Treatment is aimed at relieving the pupillary block.

Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents (e.g., ranibizumab, bevacizumab, or aflibercept) may be used to promote regression of iris NV prior to, or in conjunction with, filtering surgery or PRP. Their effect is temporary, and their use for treatment of NV is currently off-label. They are particularly useful in stage 1 and 2 neovascular glaucoma, where the angle is still open, to prevent angle closure during the interval required for PRP to take effect. Caution should be used when no view of the retina is possible.

Critical. Corneal endothelial changes (fine, beaten-bronze appearance); microcystic corneal edema; localized, irregular, high PAS that often extend anterior to Schwalbe line; deep central anterior chamber; iris alterations as follows: • Essential iris atrophy: Marked iris thinning leading to iris holes with displacement and distortion of the pupil (corectopia). Usually good prognosis. • Chandler syndrome: Mild iris thinning and corectopia. The corneal and angle changes are most marked in this variant. Degree of findings are highly variable. Patients often have corneal edema even at normal IOP. Accounts for about 50% of ICE syndrome cases. Variable prognosis. • Iris nevus/Cogan–Reese syndrome: Pigmented nodules (not true nevi) on the iris surface, variable iris atrophy. Similar changes may be seen in Chandler syndrome and essential iris atrophy, resulting from contraction of the membrane over the iris, constricting around small islands of iris tissue.

Laser suture lysis or removal of releasable sutures may be indicated to increase filtration over the scleral flap. \\3. Topical pilocarpine or slow intracameral injection of acetylcholine can pull the iris out of the sclerostomy if iris incarceration developed within the past 2 to 3 days.

Large bleb with a deep chamber (overfiltration): It is often beneficial to have a large bleb in the first few weeks after trabeculectomy. However, treatment is appropriate if it is still present 6 to 8 weeks after surgery, the patient is symptomatic, IOP is decreasing, or the anterior chamber is shallowing. Treatment includes topical atropine 1% b.i.d., intracameral viscoelastic, and possibly autologous blood injection into the bleb. Observation is recommended if the IOP is low but stable, the vision is stable at presurgical baseline, and the anterior chamber is deep. \\2. Large bleb with a flat chamber (Grade I or II): Treatment includes cycloplegics (atropine 1% t.i.d.) and careful observation. If the anterior chamber becomes more shallow (i.e., Grade I becoming Grade II), the IOP decreases as the bleb flattens, or choroidal detachment develops, the anterior chamber may be reformed with a viscoelastic material. \\3. No bleb with flat chamber: Check carefully for a wound leak by Seidel testing (SEE APPENDIX 5, SEIDEL TEST TO DETECT A WOUND LEAK). If positive, aqueous suppressants, bandage contact lens, patching, or surgical closure may be necessary. If negative, look for a cyclodialysis cleft (by gonioscopy and UBM) or serous choroidal detachments. Cyclodialysis clefts are managed by cycloplegics, laser or cryotherapy (to close the cleft), or surgical closure. Serous choroidal detachments are often observed, since in most cases they resolve when the IOP normalizes. SEE 11.27, CHOROIDAL EFFUSION/DETACHMENT. \\4.

The abnormal pupil is constricted. • Unilateral exposure to a miotic agent (e.g., pilocarpine). • Iritis: Eye pain, redness, and anterior chamber cell and flare. NOTE: In cases of inflammation resulting in posterior synechiae formation, the abnormal pupil may appear irregular, nonreactive, and/or larger. • Horner syndrome: Mild ptosis on the side of the small pupil. SEE 10.2, HORNER SYNDROME. • Argyll Robertson (i.e., syphilitic) pupil: Always bilateral, irregularly round miotic pupils, but a mild degree of anisocoria is often present.

The abnormal pupil is dilated. • Iris sphincter muscle damage from trauma or surgery: Torn pupillary margin or iris transillumination defects seen on slit lamp examination. • Adie (tonic) pupil: The pupil may be irregular, reacts minimally to light, and slowly and tonically to convergence. Hypersensitive to pilocarpine 0.125%. SEE 10.4, ADIE (TONIC) PUPIL. • Third cranial nerve palsy: Always associated ptosis and/or extraocular muscle palsies. SEE 10.5, ISOLATED THIRD NERVE PALSY. • Unilateral exposure to a mydriatic agent: Cycloplegic drops (e.g., atropine), scopolamine patch for motion sickness, ill-fitting mask in patients on nebulizers (using ipratropium bromide), possible use of sympathetic medications (e.g., pseudoephedrine). If the mydriatic exposure is recent, pupil will not react to pilocarpine 1%. \\3. Physiologic anisocoria: Pupil size disparity is the same in light as in dark, and the pupils react normally to light. The size difference is usually, but not always, \u003c2 mm in diameter.

History: When was the anisocoria first noted? Associated symptoms or signs? Ocular trauma? Eye drops or ointments? Syphilis? Old photographs? \\2. Ocular examination: Try to determine which pupil is abnormal by comparing pupil sizes in light and in dark. Anisocoria greater in light suggests the abnormal pupil is the larger pupil; anisocoria greater in dark suggests the abnormal pupil is the smaller pupil. Test the pupillary reaction to both light and near. Evaluate for the presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect. Look for ptosis, evaluate ocular motility, and examine the pupillary margin with a slit lamp. • If the abnormal pupil is small, a diagnosis of Horner syndrome may be confirmed by a cocaine or apraclonidine test (SEE 10.2, HORNER SYNDROME). In the presence of ptosis and an unequivocal increase in anisocoria in dim illumination, cocaine and apraclonidine testing may be unnecessary. • If the abnormal pupil is large and there is no sphincter muscle damage or signs of third nerve palsy (e.g., extraocular motility deficit, ptosis), the pupils are tested with one drop of pilocarpine 0.125%. Within 10 to 15 minutes, an Adie pupil will constrict significantly more than the fellow pupil ([SEE 10.4, ADIE TONIC] PUPIL) . Figure 10.1.1 Flow diagram for the work-up of anisocoria.

NOTE: For an acute Adie pupil, the pupil may not react to a weak cholinergic agent. • If the pupil does not constrict with pilocarpine 0.125%, or pharmacologic dilatation is suspected, pilocarpine 1% is instilled in both eyes. A normal pupil constricts sooner and to a greater extent than the pharmacologically dilated pupil. An eye that recently received a strong mydriatic agent such as atropine usually will not constrict at all.

Diagnosis confirmed by a relative reversal in anisocoria with apraclonidine (0.5% or 1%). The miotic pupil with Horner syndrome will appear larger than the normal pupil after apraclonidine instillation. Alternatively, 10% cocaine may be used. Place one drop of 10% cocaine in both eyes. Check in 15 minutes. If no change in pupillary size is noted, repeat drops and recheck the pupils in 15 minutes (repeat until normal pupil dilates). A Horner pupil dilates less than the normal pupil. NOTE: There may be a high false-negative rate to pharmacologic testing in an acute Horner syndrome. \\2. A third-order neuron disorder may be distinguished from a first- and second-order neuron disorder with hydroxyamphetamine. Place one drop of 1% hydroxyamphetamine in both eyes. Check in 15 minutes and repeat if no change in pupillary size is noted. Failure of the Horner pupil to dilate to an equivalent degree as the fellow eye indicates a third-order neuron lesion, which may help guide the work-up. However, most experts feel the entire sympathetic pathway should be imaged in Horner syndrome regardless of the results of pharmacologic testing. Additionally, hydroxyamphetamine is often unavailable even from compounding pharmacies. NOTE: The hydroxyamphetamine test has a sensitivity of up to 93% and a specificity of 83% for identifying a third-order neuron lesion.

History: Onset and duration of the diplopia? Misaligned eyes or head tilt since early childhood? Trauma? Stroke? \\2. Examine old photographs to determine whether the head tilt is long-standing, indicating a chronic or congenital fourth nerve palsy. \\3. Perform the three-step test: Step 1: Determine which eye is deviated upward in primary gaze. This is best seen with the cover–uncover test (SEE APPENDIX 3, COVER/UNCOVER AND ALTERNATE COVER TESTS). The higher eye comes down after being uncovered. Step 2: Determine whether the upward deviation is greater when the patient looks to the left or to the right. Step 3: Determine whether the upward deviation is greater when tilting the head to the left shoulder or right shoulder. • Patients with a superior oblique muscle paresis have a hyperdeviation that is worse on contralateral gaze and when tilting the head toward the shoulder ipsilateral to the affected eye. • In addition to the findings on the three-step test, the hypertropia should be greater in downgaze than in upgaze. • Patients with bilateral fourth nerve palsies demonstrate hypertropia of the right eye when looking left, hypertropia of the left eye when looking right, and a “V”-pattern esotropia (the eyes cross more when looking down due to a decrease of the abducting effect of the superior oblique muscles in depression as well as overaction of the inferior oblique muscles). \\4. Perform the double Maddox rod test if bilateral fourth nerve palsies are suspected to measure total excyclotorsion. • A white Maddox rod is placed before one eye and a red Maddox rod is placed before the other eye in a trial frame or phoropter, aligning the axes of each rod along the 90 degrees vertical mark. While looking at a white light in the distance, the patient is asked if both the white and red lines seen through the Maddox rods are horizontal and parallel to each other. If not, the patient is asked to rotate the Maddox rod(s) until they are parallel. If he or she rotates the top of this vertical axis outward (away from the nose) for more than 10 degrees total for the two eyes, then a bilateral superior oblique muscle paresis is likely present. NOTE: The double Maddox rod test (or variations thereof) can be used to evaluate any suspected underlying strabismus and can help the practitioner measure ocular misalignment and subtle deviations. \\5. Measure vertical fusional amplitudes with a vertical prism bar to distinguish a congenital from an acquired palsy. • A patient with an acquired fourth nerve palsy has a normal vertical fusional amplitude of 6 prism diopters or less. A patient with a congenital fourth nerve palsy has greater than 6 prism diopters of fusional amplitude. \\6.

Pupils uninvolved. No proptosis. SEE 10.11, MYASTHENIA GRAVIS. • CPEO: Progressive, painless, bilateral motility limitation with ptosis. Normal pupils. Orbicularis always weak. SEE 10.12, CHRONIC PROGRESSIVE EXTERNAL OPHTHALMOPLEGIA. • Orbital lesions (e.g., tumor, thyroid disease, inflammation). Proptosis and increased resistance to retropulsion are usually present, in addition to motility restriction. Results of forced duction tests are abnormal (SEE APPENDIX 6, FORCED DUCTION TEST AND ACTIVE FORCE GENERATION TEST). May have an afferent pupillary defect if the optic nerve is involved. NOTE: Orbital apex syndrome combines the superior orbital fissure syndrome with optic nerve dysfunction, and most commonly results from an orbital lesion. • Brainstem disease: Tumors and vascular lesions of the brainstem can produce ocular motor nerve palsies, particularly the sixth cranial nerve. MRI of the brain is best for making this diagnosis. • Carcinomatous meningitis: Diffuse seeding of the leptomeninges by metastatic tumor cells can produce a rapidly sequential bilateral cranial nerve disorder. Workup includes neuroimaging and LP. • Skull base tumors, especially nasopharyngeal carcinoma or clivus lesions: Most commonly affects the sixth cranial nerve, but the second, third, fourth, and fifth cranial nerves may be involved as well. Typically, one cranial nerve after another is affected by invasion of the skull base. The patient may have cervical lymphadenopathy, nasal obstruction, ear pain, or popping caused by serous otitis media or blockage of the Eustachian tube, weight loss, or proptosis. • Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP): Vertical limitation of eye movements, typically beginning with downward gaze. Postural instability, dementia, and rigidity of the neck and trunk may be present. All eye movements are eventually lost. SEE 10.12, CHRONIC PROGRESSIVE EXTERNAL OPHTHALMOPLEGIA. • Rare: Myotonic dystrophy, bulbar variant of the Guillain–Barré syndrome (Miller–Fisher variant), intracranial sarcoidosis, others.

Enhanced ocular pulsation (“pulsatile proptosis”) may occur, usually discernible on slit lamp examination during applanation. A bruit may be heard by the patient, and sometimes by the physician with auscultation around the globe or temple. Reversed, arterialized flow in the superior ophthalmic vein is detectable with orbital color Doppler US. Orbital CT or MRI may show an enlarged superior ophthalmic vein. MRA or CTA may reveal the fistula (but definitive diagnosis usually requires arteriography). High-flow fistulas have an abrupt onset and are most commonly caused by trauma or rupture of an intracavernous aneurysm, whereas low-flow fistulas have a more insidious presentation, most commonly in hypertensive women \u003e50 years of age, and are due to dural arteriovenous malformations. The Barrow classification is used for preoperative planning and subdivides carotid–cavernous fistulas as follows: Figure 10.10.1 Carotid–cavernous fistula with dilated and tortuous episcleral and conjunctival vessels. A. Direct fistula. B. Indirect with branches solely from internal carotid artery (rare). C. Indirect with branches solely from external carotid artery. D. Indirect with branches from both internal and external carotid arteries (most common). • Tumors within the cavernous sinus: May be primary intracranial neoplasms with local invasion of the cavernous sinus (e.g., meningioma, pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma); or metastatic tumors to the cavernous sinus, either local (e.g., nasopharyngeal carcinoma, perineural spread of a periocular squamous cell carcinoma) or distant metastasis (e.g., breast, lung, lymphoma). NOTE: Previously resected tumors may invade the cavernous sinus years after resection. • Intracavernous aneurysm: Usually not ruptured. If aneurysm does rupture, the signs of a carotid–cavernous fistula develop. • Zygomycosis (such as mucormycosis): Must be suspected in all diabetic patients, particularly those in ketoacidosis, and any debilitated or immunocompromised individual with multiple cranial nerve palsies, with or without proptosis. Onset is typically acute. Bloody nasal discharge may be present, and nasal examination may reveal a black, crusty material. This condition is life threatening. • Pituitary apoplexy: Acute onset of the critical signs listed previously; often bilateral with severe headache, decreased vision, and possibly bitemporal hemianopsia or blindness. A pre-existing pituitary adenoma may enlarge during pregnancy and predispose to apoplexy. Peripartum hemorrhage/shock can cause an infarction of the pituitary gland, leading to apoplexy of a nontumorous pituitary gland (Sheehan syndrome). An enlarged sella turcica or an intrasellar mass, usually with acute hemorrhage, is seen on CT scan or MRI of the brain. • Varicella zoster: Patients with the typical zoster rash may develop ocular motor nerve palsies as well as a mid-dilated pupil that reacts better to convergence than to light. • Cavernous sinus thrombosis: Proptosis, chemosis, and eyelid edema. Usually bilateral. Fever, nausea, vomiting, and an altered level of consciousness often develop. May result from spread of infection from the face, mouth, throat, sinus, or orbit. Less commonly noninfectious, resulting from trauma or surgery. • Tolosa–Hunt syndrome: Acute idiopathic inflammation of the superior orbital fissure or anterior cavernous sinus. Orbital pain often precedes restriction of eye movements. Recurrent episodes are common. This is a diagnosis of exclusion. • Others: Sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis), mucocele, tuberculosis, and other infectious and inflammatory conditions.

History: Do the signs fluctuate throughout the day and worsen with fatigue? Any systemic weakness? Difficulty swallowing, chewing, or breathing? Medications? \\2. Assess for presence of fatigability: Measure the degree of ptosis in primary gaze. Have the patient focus on your finger in upgaze for 1 minute. Observe whether the ptosis worsens. \\3. Assess orbicularis strength by asking the patient to squeeze the eyelids shut while you attempt to force them open. \\4. Test pupillary function. \\5. Blood test for acetylcholine receptor antibodies (binding, blocking, and modulating). An elevated antibody titer establishes the diagnosis of myasthenia. However, values may be positive in only 60% to 88% of patients with myasthenia and are less likely to be positive in purely ocular myasthenia gravis. Anti muscle–specific kinase (MUSK) antibodies are found in some patients who are negative for acetylcholine receptor antibodies, but those patients usually have systemic findings and have signs/symptoms that are not isolated to extraocular muscle function. \\6. In adults, ice test (see later), rest test (see later), or less commonly edrophonium chloride or neostigmine test may confirm the diagnosis. Edrophonium chloride testing is rarely used, however can be performed as follows: \\1. Identify one prominent feature (e.g., ptosis, diplopia) to observe during test. Have a cardiac monitor (not portable) and injectable atropine readily available. \\2. Inject edrophonium chloride 0.2 mL (2 mg) i.v. Observe for 1 minute. If an improvement in the selected feature is noted, the test is positive and may be stopped at this point. If no improvement with the medication develops, continue. Stop immediately if untoward reaction occurs. \\3. Inject edrophonium chloride 0.4 mL (4 mg) i.v. Observe for 30 seconds for a response or side effect. If neither develops, proceed. \\4. Inject edrophonium chloride 0.4 mL (4 mg) i.v. If no improvement is noted within two additional minutes, the test is negative. Improvement within the stated time period is diagnostic of myasthenia gravis (rarely a patient with CPEO, an intracavernous tumor, or some other rare disorder will have a false-positive result). A negative test does not exclude myasthenia. NOTE: Cholinergic crisis, syncopal episode, and respiratory arrest, although rare, may be precipitated by the edrophonium chloride test. Treatment includes atropine 0.4 mg i.v., while monitoring vital signs. Consider pretreating with atropine to prevent problems. NOTE: Intramuscular neostigmine may be used instead of edrophonium chloride in children or in patients where injecting intravenous medication is problematic. The effect has a longer onset and lasts for approximately 2 to 4 hours. \\7. For the ice test, an ice pack is placed over closed ptotic eye(s) for 2 minutes. Improvement of ptosis by at least 2 mm is a positive test (see Figures 10.11.1 and 10.11.2 ). \\8. In children, observation for improvement immediately after a 1- to 2-hour nap (sleep test) is a safe alternative. A similar rest test (keeping eyes closed) for 30 minutes in adults may be similarly diagnostic. Figure 10.11.1. Myasthenia gravis with left ptosis. Figure 10.11.2. Myasthenia gravis after ice-pack test showing improvement of left-sided ptosis. \\9.

If the condition is mild, purely ocular, and is not disturbing to the patient, therapy need not be instituted (the patient may patch one eye as needed). \\3. If the condition is disturbing or more severe, an oral anticholinesterase agent such as pyridostigmine should be given (often starting with 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. gradually increasing to an approximate dose of 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. for an adult). The dosage must be adjusted according to the response. Patients rarely benefit from \u003e120 mg p.o. q3h of pyridostigmine. Overdosage may produce cholinergic crisis. \\4.

Other signs may include hearing loss, mental retardation, cerebellar signs, short stature, delayed puberty, nephropathy, vestibular abnormalities, increased cerebrospinal fluid protein, and characteristic “ragged red fiber” findings on muscle biopsy. Although some are inherited maternally, the vast majority are due to spontaneous mitochondrial deletions. • PSP (Steele–Richardson–Olszewski syndrome): Rare progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting the brainstem that causes early gait instability and ophthalmoplegia. Often downgaze affected first followed by other gaze limitations; vertical more than horizontal. Other eye movement problems include abnormalities in the saccadic and pursuit subsystems of horizontal gaze. Often the eyelids are held wide open resulting in a “staring” type of facial expression. Neck and axial rigidity is an important sign. • Abetalipoproteinemia (Bassen–Kornzweig syndrome): Retinal pigmentary degeneration similar to retinitis pigmentosa, diarrhea, ataxia, and other neurologic signs. Acanthocytosis of red blood cells are seen on peripheral blood smear and LP demonstrates increased cerebrospinal fluid protein.

If MRI reveals at least one typical area of demyelination, offer pulsed intravenous steroid in the following regimen within 14 days of decreased vision: • Methylprednisolone 1 g/day i.v. for 3 days, then • Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day p.o. for 11 days, then • Taper prednisone over 4 days (20 mg on day 1, 10 mg on days 2 through 4). • Antiulcer medication (e.g., omeprazole 20 mg p.o. daily or ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.) for gastric prophylaxis. NOTE: The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) found steroid treatment reduced initial progression to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) for 3 years. Steroid therapy only increases the rapidity of visual return but does not improve final visual outcome. \\2. If MRI shows two or more characteristic demyelinating lesions, treat with the aforementioned steroid regimen. Refer to neurologist or neuro-ophthalmologist for possible treatment with interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, or teriflunomide. Patients with one or more typical signal changes on MRI have a 72% chance of developing CDMS over 15 years. NOTE: NEVER use oral prednisone as a primary treatment because of increased risk of recurrence found in ONTT.

Lesion typically involves the parasellar region and chiasm. Typically pendular when chiasmal region involved, and jerk if involving the midbrain. One proposal suggests a unilateral lesion of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal or its connections are responsible for this nystagmus subtype. May have a bitemporal hemianopsia resulting from chiasmal compression. May be congenital or associated with septo-optic dysplasia. • Convergence retraction: Not a true nystagmus, but convergence-like eye movements accompanied by globe retraction when the patient attempts an upward saccade. May be associated with limitation of upward gaze, eyelid retraction, and bilateral mid-dilated pupils that react poorly to light but constrict better with convergence. Papilledema may be present. Usually, a pineal region tumor or other dorsal midbrain abnormality is responsible. SEE 10.4, ADIE (TONIC) PUPIL. • Gaze evoked: Absent in primary gaze, but appears as the eyes look to the side. Nystagmus increases when looking in the direction of fast phase. Slow frequency. Most commonly the result of alcohol intoxication, sedatives, cerebellar or brainstem disease. • Downbeat: The fast phase of nystagmus is down and most prominent looking down and to the right and left. Most commonly, either a manifestation of cerebellar degeneration or associated with a lesion at the cervicomedullary junction (e.g., Arnold–Chiari malformation). • Periodic alternating: In primary position, fast eye movements are in one direction for 60 to 90 seconds and then reverse direction for 60 to 90 seconds. The cycle repeats continuously. Patients may attempt to minimize nystagmus with periodic head turning. May be congenital. Acquired forms are most commonly the result of lesions of the cervicomedullary junction and posterior fossa. Other causes include MS, medication side effects, and rarely blindness. • Peripheral vestibular: Horizontal or horizontal-rotary nystagmus. May be accompanied by vertigo, tinnitus, or deafness. May be due to dysfunction of vestibular end organ (inner ear disease), eighth cranial nerve, or eighth nerve nucleus in brainstem. Destructive lesions produce fast phases opposite to lesion. Irritative lesions (e.g., Meniere disease) produce fast phase in the same direction as the lesion. Vestibular nystagmus associated with interstitial keratitis is called Cogan syndrome. • Spasmus nutans: See above. • Others: Rebound nystagmus (cerebellar lesions), Bruns nystagmus (CPA), oculomasticatory myorhythmia (Whipple disease), oculopalatal myoclonus (prior brainstem stroke).

Test for an afferent pupillary defect (U): A defect should be present in unilateral or asymmetric visual loss to this degree. If not, the likelihood of nonphysiologic visual loss substantially increases. \\2. Mirror test (U or B): If the patient claims unilateral visual loss, cover the better-seeing eye; with bilateral complaints leave both eyes uncovered. Ask the patient to hold eyes still and slowly tilt a large mirror from side to side in front of the eyes, holding it beyond the patient’s range of hand motion vision.

Ask the patient to look straight ahead and slowly move an optokinetic tape in front of the eyes (or rotate an optokinetic drum). If nystagmus can be elicited, vision is better than counting fingers. Note: Some patients can purposely minimize or suppress an ocular response by diverting focus past the drum. \\4. Base-out prism test (U): Place a 4–6 diopter prism base-out in front of the supposedly poorly-seeing eye.

Inform the patient you will go to a larger line and show the 20/15 line. Again, force the patient to work to see this line. Slowly proceed up the chart, asking the patient to read each line as you pass it (including the three or four 20/20 lines). It may help to express disbelief that the patient cannot read such large letters. By the time the 20/30 or 20/40 lines are reached, the patient may in fact read one or two letters correctly. The visual acuity can then be recorded. \\2. Fog test (U): Dial the patient’s refractive correction into the phoropter. Add +4.00 to the normally seeing eye. Put the patient in the phoropter with both eyes open. Tell the patient to use both eyes to read each line, starting at the 20/15 line and working up the chart slowly, as described previously. Record visual acuity with both eyes open (this should be visual acuity of supposedly poorly-seeing eye) and document the vision of the “good eye” through the +4.00 lens to prove the vision obtained was from the “bad eye.” \\3. Retest visual acuity in the supposedly poorly seeing eye at 10 feet from the chart (U or B): Vision should be twice as good (e.g., a patient with 20/100 vision at 20 feet should read 20/50 at 10 feet).

Diabetic retinopathy is usually evident in the contralateral eye. In VH due to PDR, the peripheral retina is often visible on indirect ophthalmoscopy. SEE 11.12, DIABETIC RETINOPATHY. • PVD: Common in middle-aged or elderly patients. Usually patients note floaters and flashing lights. SEE 11.1, POSTERIOR VITREOUS DETACHMENT. • Retinal break: Commonly superior in cases of dense VH. This may be demonstrated by scleral depression and, if poor view, B-scan US. SEE 11.2, RETINAL BREAK. • Retinal detachment: May be diagnosed by B-scan US if the retina cannot be viewed on clinical examination. SEE 11.3, RETINAL DETACHMENT. • Retinal vein occlusion (usually a BRVO): Commonly occurs in older patients with a history of high blood pressure. SEE 11.9, BRANCH RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION. • Exudative age-related macular degeneration (ARMD): Usually with a disciform scar or advanced choroidal neovascular membrane. Poor vision before the VH as a result of their underlying disease. Macular drusen and/or other findings of ARMD are found in the contralateral eye. B-scan US may aid in the diagnosis. SEE 11.17, NEOVASCULAR OR EXUDATIVE (WET) AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION. • Sickle cell disease: May have peripheral retinal neovascularization in the contralateral eye, typically in a “sea-fan” configuration and salmon color. SEE 11.20, SICKLE CELL DISEASE (INCLUDING SICKLE CELL ANEMIA, SICKLE TRAIT). • Trauma: By history. • Intraocular tumor: May be visible on ophthalmoscopy or B-scan US. SEE 5.13, MALIGNANT MELANOMA OF THE IRIS AND 11.36, CHOROIDAL NEVUS AND MALIGNANT MELANOMA OF THE CHOROID. • Subarachnoid or subdural hemorrhage (Terson syndrome): Frequently bilateral preretinal or VHs may occur. A severe headache usually precedes the fundus findings. Coma may occur. • Eales disease: Usually occurs in men aged 20 to 30 years with peripheral retinal ischemia and neovascularization of unknown etiology. Decreased vision as a result of VH is frequently the presenting sign. Typically bilateral. Diagnosis of exclusion. • Others: Ruptured arterial macroaneurysm, Coats disease, retinopathy of prematurity, retinal capillary angiomas of von Hippel–Lindau syndrome, congenital prepapillary vascular loop, retinal cavernous hemangioma, HTN, radiation retinopathy, anterior segment hemorrhage because of an intraocular lens, bleeding diathesis, hematologic malignancy, etc. See specific sections.

The original Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) report demonstrated that treatment with a high-dose combination of vitamin C (500 mg), vitamin E (400 IU), beta-carotene (15 mg), zinc (80 mg), and cupric oxide (5 mg) reduces the risk of progression to advanced ARMD by approximately 25% over 5 years and reduces the risk of vision loss caused by advanced ARMD by approximately 19% by 5 years. A second study (AREDS2), evaluated the role of increased intake of different carotenoids (lutein and zeaxanthin) as well as two specific omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] + eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]). The addition of lutein + zeaxanthin, DHA + EPA, or both to the original AREDS formulation did not further reduce risk of progression to advanced AMD but was found to be equally effective. NOTE: Beta-carotene (in the original AREDS formula) should be withheld in past or present smokers because of increased risk of lung cancer. The AREDS2 formulation (with lutein + zeaxanthin) is preferred as it does not contain beta-carotene. In addition, recommend consumption of green leafy vegetables if approved by primary care physician (intake of vitamin K decreases effectiveness of warfarin) and fish/fish oils containing high levels of omega-3 fatty acids. \\1. Low-vision aids may benefit some patients with bilateral loss of macular function. \\2. Refer to an internist for management of presumed risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, smoking cessation, etc. \\3. Those at high risk for progressing to exudative AMD may benefit from home monitoring technology for earlier detection (ForseeHome). Although this technology is in its infancy, early detection of CNV increases the likelihood of better visual acuity results after intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy is initiated. \\4. Certain genetic mutations confer an increased risk for ARMD (e.g., Y402H mutation of the complement factor H gene) and may influence response to treatment.

In the original phase 3 efficacy trials (MARINA and ANCHOR), ranibizumab was given monthly to patients with close to 40% of patients in both studies gaining three or more lines of visual acuity at 1 year. While the best visual results may occur with monthly dosing, prn dosing using OCT guidance (PrONTO study) had similar 1 year visual results with half the number of injections. • Aflibercept: Anti-VEGF fusion protein that binds all isoforms of VEGF-A and placental growth factor. FDA-approved as intravitreal injection for the treatment of neovascular ARMD. Phase 3 studies showed similar efficacy at 1 year to monthly intravitreal ranibizumab with aflibercept dosed q8 weeks after a 12-week monthly induction phase. • Bevacizumab: Full-length anti-VEGF antibody. FDA-approved for colon cancer. Off-label use as intravitreal injection at a dose of 1.25 mg is effective in treating all types of neovascular ARMD. It is cost-effective and commonly used in place of ranibizumab. The Comparison of Age-related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trial (CATT) study demonstrated the noninferiority of bevacizumab as compared to ranibizumab at 1 year, when monthly or prn dosing was used. • Pegaptanib: Anti-VEGF aptamer injected intravitreally every 6 weeks for 1 to 2 years.

Follow serum ornithine levels to determine the amount of supplemental vitamin B6 and the degree to which dietary protein needs to be restricted. Serum ornithine levels between 0.15 and 0.2 mmol/L are optimal. NOTE: Only a small percentage of patients are vitamin B6 responders. • Choroideremia: Males present in the first to second decade of life with nyctalopia, followed by insidious loss of peripheral vision. Decreased central vision occurs late. In males, early findings include dispersed pigment granules in the periphery with focal areas of RPE atrophy. Late findings include total absence of RPE and choriocapillaris. No bone spicules. Retinal arteriolar narrowing and optic atrophy can occur late in the process. Constriction of visual fields, normal color vision, markedly reduced ERG. Female carriers have small, scattered, square intraretinal pigment granules overlying choroidal atrophy, most marked in the midperiphery.

Positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), negative rheumatoid factor, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) most commonly seen. Associated with glaucoma, cataracts, band keratopathy, and CME. Uveitis may occur in polyarticular and rarely in systemic JIA (Still disease). • Chronic iridocyclitis of children: Usually occurs in young girls; is similar to JIA in signs and symptoms but lacks arthritis. • FHIC: Few symptoms, diffuse iris stromal atrophy often causing a lighter-colored iris with transillumination defects and blunting of the iris architecture. Gonioscopy may reveal fine vessels that cross the trabecular meshwork, typically without posterior synechiae. Fine KP over the entire corneal endothelium, mild anterior chamber reaction. Vitreous opacities, glaucoma, and cataracts are common, but macular edema and posterior synechiae are absent. • Sarcoidosis: More common in African Americans and Scandinavians.

Obtain a thorough history and review of systems (Tables 12.1.1 and 12.1.2 ). Specifically ask about fevers, chills, cough, shortness of breath, joint pain/swelling/stiffness, diarrhea, blood in urine/stool, skin rashes, and oral or genital ulcers. NOTE: Autoimmune diseases are less common in the very young and very old—consider masquerades. \\2. Complete ocular examination, including an IOP check, gonioscopy, and a dilated fundus examination. The vitreous should be evaluated for cells. \\3. A laboratory work-up may be unnecessary in certain situations: • First episode of a mild, unilateral, nongranulomatous uveitis with a history and examination that is not suggestive of systemic disease. • Uveitis in the setting of known systemic disease such as sarcoidosis or the use of medicines known to cause uveitis (e.g., rifabutin). • Clinical findings are classic for a particular diagnosis (e.g., herpetic keratouveitis, FHIC, toxoplasmosis). \\4. In all other situations requiring laboratory or diagnostic testing, performing a targeted work-up is recommended. If too many tests are ordered unnecessarily, a portion of them may come back false-positive and confuse the diagnosis. See Table 12.1.3. However, if a patient presents with bilateral, granulomatous, or recurrent uveitis without a suspected diagnosis, our practice is to at least evaluate for sarcoidosis, syphilis, and TB (in at-risk patients). Consider additional work-up as needed based on history and examination. • Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL). Also need confirmatory test such as fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) or treponemal-specific assay (e.g., microhemagglutination assay [MHA-TP]) given RPR and VDRL may be falsely negative.

NOTE: In children with uveitis, it is recommended to perform ANA, RF, HLA-B27, urinalysis and renal function tests. Evaluation for systemic disease by a pediatric rheumatologist may be warranted (e.g., JIA, TINU).

Cycloplegic (e.g., cyclopentolate 1% t.i.d. for mild to moderate inflammation; atropine 1% b.i.d. to q.i.d. for severe inflammation). \\2. Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1%) q1-6h, depending on severity of inflammation. Most cases of moderate to severe acute uveitis require q1–2h dosing initially. Difluprednate 0.05% may allow less frequent dosing than prednisolone acetate. Consider a loading dose (prednisolone acetate 1% one drop every minute for 5 minutes) or fluorometholone 0.1% ophthalmic ointment at night. If the anterior uveitis is severe, unilateral, and is not responding to topical steroids, then consider periocular repository steroids (e.g., 0.5 to 1.0 mL subtenon injection of triamcinolone 40 mg/mL). SEE APPENDIX 10, TECHNIQUE FOR RETROBULBAR/SUBTENON/SUBCONJUNCTIVAL INJECTIONS. NOTE: Periocular use of triamcinolone is off-label and must be discussed with patients. A trial of topical steroids at full strength for several weeks may help identify patients at risk of a significant IOP increase from steroids. Additionally, periocular depot steroids should be used with extreme caution in patients with scleritis because of possible scleral melting. \\3. If there is no improvement on maximal topical and repository steroids, or if the uveitis is bilateral and severe, consider systemic steroids, or immunosuppressive therapy. Consider referral to a uveitis specialist and rheumatologist. NOTE: Prior to initiating systemic steroids or periocular depot steroids, it is important to rule out infectious causes. \\4. Treat secondary glaucoma with aqueous suppressants. Avoid pilocarpine. Glaucoma may result from: • Cellular blockage of the trabecular meshwork. SEE 9.7, INFLAMMATORY OPEN ANGLE GLAUCOMA. • Secondary angle closure from synechiae formation. SEE 9.4, ACUTE ANGLE CLOSURE GLAUCOMA. • Neovascularization of the iris and angle. SEE 9.14, NEOVASCULAR GLAUCOMA. • Steroid-response. SEE 9.9, STEROID-RESPONSE GLAUCOMA. \\5. If an exact etiology for the anterior uveitis is determined, then additional ocular and/or systemic management may be indicated. • Ankylosing spondylitis: Often requires systemic anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., NSAIDs such as naproxen). Consider consulting rheumatology, physical therapy, and cardiology (increased incidence of cardiomegaly, conduction defects, and aortic insufficiency). • Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Often benefits from systemic steroids, sulfadiazine, or other immunosuppressive agents. Obtain a medical or gastrointestinal consult. • Reactive arthritis (previously known as Reiter syndrome): If urethritis is present, then the patient and sexual partners are treated for chlamydia (e.g., single dose azithromycin 1 g p.o.). Obtain medical and/or rheumatology or urology consult. • Psoriatic arthritis: Consider a rheumatology and/or dermatology consult. • Glaucomatocyclitic crisis: SEE 9.8, GLAUCOMATOCYCLITIC CRISIS/POSNER–SCHLOSSMAN SYNDROME. • Lens-induced uveitis: Usually requires removal of lens material. SEE 9.12, *LENS-RELATED GLAUCOMA* . • Herpetic uveitis: Herpes simplex typically requires topical or oral antivirals and steroid drops for non-epithelial corneal disease. Herpetic iridocyclitis benefits from topical steroids and systemic antiviral medications (e.g., acyclovir/valacyclovir); topical antivirals are ineffective for uveitis due to poor intraocular penetration. SEE 4.15, HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS AND 4.16, HERPES ZOSTER OPHTHALMICUS/VARICELLA ZOSTER VIRUS. • UGH syndrome: SEE 9.16, POSTOPERATIVE GLAUCOMA. • Behçet disease: SEE 12.7, BEHçET DISEASE. • Lyme disease: SEE 13.3, LYME DISEASE. • JIA: Steroid dosage is adjusted according to the degree of anterior chamber cells, not flare.

Every 1 to 7 days in the acute phase, depending on the severity; every 1 to 6 months when stable. \\2. At each visit, the anterior chamber reaction and IOP should be evaluated. \\3. A vitreous and fundus examination should be performed for all flare-ups, when vision is affected, or every 3 to 6 months. Macular edema is a frequent cause of decreased vision even after the uveitis is controlled; optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be very useful diagnostically. \\4. If the anterior chamber reaction has resolved, then the steroid drops can be slowly tapered with intermittent examinations to ensure that the inflammation does not return during the taper (usually one drop per day every 3 to 7 days [e.g., q.i.d. for 1 week, then t.i.d. for 1 week, then b.i.d. for 1 week, etc.]). Steroids are usually discontinued following the taper when the anterior chamber does not have any cellular reaction. Occasionally, long-term low-dose steroids every day or every other day are required to keep the inflammation from recurring. Punctal occlusion techniques may increase potency of drug and decrease systemic absorption. The cycloplegic agents also can be tapered off as the anterior chamber reaction improves and no new posterior synechiae are noted. NOTE: As with most ocular and systemic diseases requiring steroid therapy, the steroid should be tapered. Sudden discontinuation of steroids can lead to severe rebound inflammation. 12.2 Intermediate Uveitis ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/the_wills_eye/:1398:0","tags":["eye"],"title":"The Wills Eye Manual","uri":"/en/the_wills_eye/"},{"categories":["eye"],"content":"Symptoms Painless floaters and decreased vision.

Consider subtenon steroid (e.g., 0.5 to 1.0 mL injection of triamcinolone 40 mg/mL). May repeat the injections every 6 to 8 weeks until the vision and CME have stabilized. Slowly taper the frequency of injections. Subtenon steroid injections must be used with caution in patients with steroid-induced glaucoma. SEE APPENDIX 10, TECHNIQUE FOR RETROBULBAR/SUBTENON/SUBCONJUNCTIVAL INJECTIONS. \\2. If minimal improvement after three subtenon steroid injections 1 to 2 months apart, consider systemic steroids (e.g., prednisone 40 to 60 mg p.o. daily for 4 to 6 weeks), tapering gradually according to the patient’s response. High-dose systemic steroid therapy should be no longer than 2 to 3 months, followed by a taper to no more than 5 to 10 mg/day. Other options include sustained-release steroid implants (e.g., dexamethasone 0.7 mg intravitreal implant; fluocinolone acetonide 0.19 or 0.59 mg intravitreal implant) and immunomodulatory therapy, often in conjunction with rheumatology. NOTE: In bilateral cases, systemic steroid therapy may be preferred to periocular injections. However, in children and adolescents, growth suppression (in addition to the usual complications of long-term systemic steroids) is a major concern. \\3. Transscleral cryotherapy to the area of snowbanking should be considered in patients who fail to respond to either oral or subtenon corticosteroids and who have neovascularization. \\4. Pars plana vitrectomy may be useful in cases refractory to systemic steroids or to treat vitreous opacification, tractional retinal detachment, ERM, and other complications. Additionally, vitreous biopsy through a pars plana vitrectomy may be indicated in cases of suspected masquerade syndromes, especially intraocular lymphoma. NOTE: \\1. Some physicians delay steroid injections for several weeks to observe whether the IOP increases on topical steroids (steroid response). If a marked steroid response is found, depot injections should be avoided. \\2. Topical NSAIDs are usually not effective in patients with uveitic CME. \\3. Cataracts are a frequent complication of intermediate uveitis. If cataract extraction is performed, the patient should ideally be free of inflammation for 3 months preceding the operation. Consider starting the patient on oral prednisone 60 mg daily 5 days prior to surgery and tapering the prednisone over the next month.

Usually spontaneously improves over weeks to months without treatment. May be associated with a cerebral vasculitis (consider MRA if patient has headache or other neurologic symptoms), in which case systemic steroids are indicated. • Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS): Photopsias and acute unilateral visual loss, often after a viral illness and usually in young women. May have a shimmering scotoma. Uncommonly bilateral or sequential. Characterized by multiple, small white lesions deep in the retina or at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium with foveal granularity and occasionally vitreous cells. Fluorescein angiography may show classic perifoveal “wreath-like” pattern. There is often an enlarged blind spot on formal visual field testing. Vision typically returns to normal within weeks without treatment. Figure 12.3.1. Fundus photographs of right (A) and left (B) eye showing creamy yellow subretinal lesions in APMPPE. Note a pigmented choroidal nevus along inferotemporal arcade in left eye. • Birdshot retinochoroidopathy: Usually middle-aged patients with bilateral, multiple, creamy-yellow spots deep to the retina, approximately 1 mm in diameter, scattered throughout the fundus but most prominent in inferior quadrants. A mild to moderate vitritis is present. Retinal vasculitis, CME, and optic nerve edema may be present. ICG angiography shows characteristic hypofluorescent spots but fluorescein angiography often shows only retinal vasculitis, CME, and “quenching” of dye. Positive HLA-A29 in 95% to 100% of patients. Early systemic immunosuppression often recommended. • Multifocal choroiditis with panuveitis: Visual loss in young myopic women, typically bilateral. Multiple, small, round, pale inflammatory lesions (similar to histoplasmosis) are located at the level of the pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris. Unlike histoplasmosis, vitritis occurs in 98% of patients. The lesions can occur in the macula and midperiphery and frequently respond to oral or periocular steroids, but typically recur with tapering, so that immunosuppressive therapy is often necessary. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is common, and so patients should return for urgent evaluation if they have decreased vision or metamorphopsia. • Punctate inner choroidopathy: Blurred vision, paracentral scotoma, and/or photopsias, usually in young myopic women. Multiple, small round yellow-white spots predominantly in posterior pole with minimal intraocular inflammation. Lesions become well-demarcated atrophic scars within weeks. CNV may develop in up to 40% of patients. Systemic immunosuppression usually indicated. • Serpiginous choroidopathy: Typically bilateral, recurrent chorioretinitis characterized by acute lesions (yellow-white subretinal patches with indistinct margins) bordering old atrophic scars. The chorioretinal changes usually extend from the optic disc outward; however, one-third may begin in the macula. Patients are typically aged 30 to 60 years. Systemic immunosuppression indicated. CNV may develop. Must be distinguished from “serpiginous” pattern of tuberculous chorioretinitis. • Toxocariasis: Typically unilateral. Usually occurs in children. The most common presentations are a macular granuloma (elevated white retinal/subretinal lesion) with poor vision, unilateral intermediate uveitis with peripheral granuloma, or endophthalmitis. A peripheral lesion may be associated with a fibrous band extending to the optic disc, sometimes resulting in macular vessel dragging. A severe vitritis and anterior uveitis may be present.

Mild peripheral retinochoroiditis. a. Self-limited in immunocompetent patients. May consider observation only for peripheral lesions. b. Treat elevated IOP with antiglaucoma medications and anterior uveitis with topical cycloplegic (e.g., cyclopentolate 1% to 2% t.i.d.) with or without topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% q2h). \\2. Treatment usually recommended for lesions in the macula, within 2 to 3 mm of the disc, threatening a large retinal vessel, associated with severe vitritis causing decreased vision, or disease in an immunocompromised patient. Immunocompromised patients may require extended treatment. a. Classic first-line triple therapy (for 4 to 6 weeks): • Pyrimethamine, 200 mg p.o. load (or two 100 mg doses p.o. 12 hours apart), and then 25 to 50 mg p.o. daily. Do not give pyrimethamine to pregnant or breast-feeding women. (Spiramycin 1 g p.o. t.i.d. for women who seroconvert in pregnancy.) • Folinic acid 10 mg p.o. every other day (to minimize bone marrow toxicity of pyrimethamine). • Sulfadiazine 2 g p.o. load and then 1 g p.o. q.i.d. Expensive and difficult to obtain; trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg twice daily may be substituted as described below. • Prednisone may be added 20 to 60 mg p.o. daily beginning at least 24 hours after initiating antimicrobial therapy and tapered 10 days before stopping antibiotics. Periocular steroids should not be given. Systemic steroids should only rarely be used in immunocompromised patients. Before systemic steroid use, evaluation of fasting blood sugar/hemoglobin A1C and studies to rule out tuberculosis are prudent. NOTE: Due to potential bone marrow suppression, a CBC must be obtained once per week while a patient is taking pyrimethamine. If the platelet count decreases below 100,000, then reduce the dosage of pyrimethamine and increase the folinic acid. Patients taking pyrimethamine should not take vitamins that contain folic acid. The medication should be given with meals to reduce anorexia. b. Alternate regimens: • Clindamycin 150 to 450 mg p.o. t.i.d. to q.i.d. (maximum 1.8 g/day) may be used alone, with pyrimethamine as alternative therapy (if the patient is sulfa allergic), or as an adjunct (quadruple therapy). Patients on clindamycin should be warned about pseudomembranous colitis, and the medication should be stopped if diarrhea develops. Intravitreal injection of clindamycin (0.1 mg/0.1 mL) can be effective for macular-threatening cases, or when the patient is intolerant to systemic medication. Combined intravitreal clindamycin (0.1 mg/0.1 mL) and dexamethasone (0.4 mg/0.1 mL) have been reported helpful. • Atovaquone 750 mg p.o. q.i.d., used as alternative similar to clindamycin. • Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (160 mg/800 mg) one tablet p.o. b.i.d., with or without clindamycin and prednisone. • Azithromycin loading dose 1 g (day 1) then 250 to 500 mg daily. May be used alone or in combination with pyrimethamine (50 mg daily) • Spiramycin 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. may be considered in cases of pregnancy, but must be obtained from CDC. c. Anterior segment inflammation is treated as above. \\3. Vitrectomy has been used for nonclearing dense vitritis or other complications. \\4. Maintenance therapy (if patient is immunosuppressed) • Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg one tablet p.o. three times a week. or • If sulfa-allergic (common in HIV-infected patients), may use clindamycin 300 mg p.o. q.i.d. \\5.

SEE 12.1, ANTERIOR UVEITIS (IRITIS/IRIDOCYCLITIS) AND 12.3, POSTERIOR UVEITIS, for other uveitis work-up. \\1. Chest radiography: May reveal bilateral and symmetric hilar adenopathy and/or infiltrates indicative of pulmonary fibrosis, but may be normal in many patients and a negative result does not serve as an effective screening test. In cases of unilateral or atypical lung disease, consider malignancy. \\2. Serum ACE: Elevated in 60% to 90% of patients with active sarcoidosis. Similar to chest radiography, a normal level does not rule out sarcoidosis and elevation is not specific. HIV, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, and leprosy may also present with elevated ACE. Patients with underlying lung disease (e.g., COPD) or patients on oral steroids and/or ACE inhibitors may have falsely low ACE levels. ACE levels in children are less helpful in diagnosis. \\3. Tissue biopsy: Definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of noncaseating granulomatous inflammation. Obtain biopsy of accessible affected lesions, including lymph nodes or edges of skin plaques or nodules. Sarcoid granulomas are not present in erythema nodosum and these lesions should not be sampled. An acid-fast stain and a methenamine–silver stain may be performed to rule out tuberculosis and fungal infection. A nondirected conjunctival biopsy in the absence of visible lesions has a low yield and is not recommended. Indurated areas of tattooed skin with concurrent uveitis may suggest tattoo-associated uveitis; skin biopsy may show noncaseating granulomas while the chest x-ray (CXR) is normal. \\4. PPD or IGRA: Useful for differentiating tuberculosis from sarcoidosis when pulmonary findings are present. Up to 50% of sarcoidosis patients are anergic and have no response to PPD or controls. \\5. Other: Some authors recommend serum and urine calcium levels, liver function tests, and a serum lysozyme. A positive result on one of these tests in the absence of chest radiographic or other findings is usually not helpful in diagnosis. A serum lysozyme may be useful in children, where ACE levels are unreliable. If laboratory and chest radiographic studies suggest sarcoidosis or in the setting of a negative work-up but a high clinical suspicion of the disease, the following tests should be considered: \\1. Chest CT is more sensitive than CXR. \\2. Whole-body gallium scan is sensitive for sarcoidosis. A “panda sign” indicates involvement of lacrimal, parotid, and submandibular glands. A “lambda sign” indicates involvement of bilateral hilar and right paratracheal lymph nodes. A positive gallium scan and an elevated ACE level is 73% sensitive and 100% specific for sarcoidosis. \\3. Referral to pulmonologist for pulmonary function tests and transbronchial lung biopsy. \\4.

Prompt inpatient or outpatient treatment. The goal is to decrease the incidence of the disease in the fellow eye. Treatment does not reduce the rate of retinal detachment in the first eye. \\2. Oral antivirals (valacyclovir 1 to 2 g t.i.d. or famciclovir 500 mg t.i.d. preferred; acyclovir 800 mg five times per day second-line option as it achieves lower intravitreal levels) with supplemental intravitreal injections with foscarnet (2.4 mg/0.1 mL) or ganciclovir (2 mg/0.1 mL) given one to two times per week.

Either of these regimens is maintained for up to 14 weeks from the onset of infection. Involvement of the second eye typically starts within 6 weeks of initial infection. Published literature suggests that primary treatment with oral antivirals in conjunction with the above intravitreal injections has similar efficacy as intravenous therapy. Stabilization and early regression of retinitis is usually seen within 4 days. The lesions may progress during the first 48 hours of treatment. \\3.

Alternatively, intravenous ganciclovir 5 mg/kg b.i.d. or foscarnet 90 mg/kg b.i.d. (adjusting for renal function) may be used, followed by oral therapy valganciclovir (900 mg p.o. b.i.d. to complete 3-week induction, then 900 mg p.o. daily). Patients with progression of retinitis despite induction or who have disease that threatens the macula may benefit from intravitreal antiviral injections, but systemic therapy is still necessary to prevent involvement of the fellow eye. The goal of treatment is quiescent retinitis: nonprogressive areas of RPE atrophy with a stable opacified border. \\2. Under the direction of an internist or infectious disease specialist, HAART should be initiated or optimized; immune recovery with sustained CD4+ counts \u003e200 cells/mm3 results in decreased risk of retinal detachment, second-eye involvement, antiviral resistance, and mortality. Also, monitor for toxicity of anti-CMV therapy (valganciclovir and ganciclovir cause bone marrow toxicity; foscarnet is nephrotoxic and can cause electrolyte abnormalities and seizures; intravenous ganciclovir and foscarnet require placement of an indwelling catheter, which may cause line infection and sepsis). \\3.

Ganciclovir resistance (reflected by positive blood or urine CMV cultures) may occur at any point during treatment. \\2. All currently available anti-CMV therapy is virostatic, not virocidal, and almost all patients eventually relapse if not treated with HAART. Serial fundus photographs are quite useful. Relapse is defined as recurrent or new retinitis, movement of opacified border, or expansion of the atrophic zone. \\3. Relapse does not necessarily indicate drug resistance. Reinduction with the same medication is the first line of treatment. Subtherapeutic intraocular drug levels may occur in patients on maintenance therapy and allow for relapse. \\4. Clinical resistance is defined as persistent or progressive retinitis despite induction level medication for 6 weeks. Laboratory confirmation is possible for low-grade UL97 (viral phosphotransferase) or high-grade UL54 (viral DNA polymerase) mutations. \\5. If resistance is recognized, a change in therapy from one antiviral to the other is indicated. Consider intravenous cidofovir 5 mg/kg once weekly for 2 weeks, then 3 to 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Cidofovir itself may cause uveitis and renal impairment and must be given with probenecid to reduce the nephrotoxicity. Intravitreal cidofovir is contraindicated because of high risk of uveitis and hypotony. Cross-resistance may be a problem since all three anti-CMV drugs are CMV DNA polymerase inhibitors. \\6. Discontinuation of anti-CMV maintenance therapy may be considered in select patients receiving HAART who have CD4+ counts \u003e100 cells/mm3 for greater than 6 months and completely quiescent CMV retinitis. In these patients, whose immune system can control CMV, stopping maintenance therapy may prevent drug toxicity and drug-resistant organisms. In iatrogenically immunosuppressed patients, cessation or reduction in dosage of immunosuppressive drugs may be required for long-term control of CMV retinitis. \\7. Immune recovery uveitis (IRU): Occurs in previously immunocompromised patients (HIV/iatrogenic) with CMV after the CD4+ count or immune system reconstitutes. In the presence of a functioning immune system, the CMV antigens elicit an inflammatory response that is predominantly posterior (e.g., vitritis, papillitis, CME, ERM). Treatment may require topical, periocular, or intraocular steroids. Antivirals should be continued to avoid reactivation of CMV in cases of borderline CD4+ counts. 12.10 Noninfectious Retinal Microvasculopathy/HIV Retinopathy Noninfectious retinopathy is the most common ocular manifestation of HIV/AIDS.

SEE 12.13, POSTOPERATIVE ENDOPHTHALMITIS. • Retained lens material: A severe granulomatous inflammation with mutton-fat KP, resulting from an autoimmune reaction to lens protein exposed during surgery. SEE 9.12, LENS-RELATED GLAUCOMA. • Aseptic (sterile) endophthalmitis: A severe noninfectious postoperative uveitis caused by intraoperative injections (e.g., triamcinolone acetonide) or excess tissue manipulation, especially of vitreous manipulation, during surgery. A hypopyon and a mild vitreous cellular reaction may develop. Usually not characterized by profound or progressive pain or visual loss. Eyelid swelling and chemosis are atypical. Conjunctival injection is often absent. Usually resolves with topical steroid therapy. • TASS: An acute, sterile inflammation following uneventful surgery that develops rapidly within 6 to 24 hours. Characterized by anterior chamber cell and flare, possibly with fibrin or hypopyon, and severe corneal edema in excess of what would be expected following surgery. IOP may be increased. May be caused by any material placed in the eye during surgery including irrigating or injected solutions (e.g., due to presence of a preservative or incorrect pH or concentration of a solution) or improperly cleaned instruments. • Acute nonbacterial iridocyclitis: HLA-B27-associated uveitis and herpetic uveitis can be triggered by surgical trauma. • Persistent postoperative inflammation (e.g., beyond 6 weeks): • Poor compliance with topical steroids. • Steroid drops tapered too rapidly. • Retained lens material. • Iris or vitreous incarceration in the wound. • UGH syndrome: Irritation of the iris or ciliary body by an IOL. Increased IOP and red blood cells in the anterior chamber accompany the anterior segment inflammation. SEE 9.16, POSTOPERATIVE GLAUCOMA. • Retinal detachment: Often produces a low-grade anterior chamber reaction. SEE 11.3, RETINAL DETACHMENT. • Low-grade endophthalmitis (e.g., P. acnes and other indolent bacteria, fungal, or partially treated bacterial endophthalmitis). • Epithelial downgrowth: Corneal or conjunctival epithelium grows into the eye through a corneal wound and may be seen on the posterior corneal surface. The iris may appear flattened because of the spread of the membrane over the anterior chamber angle onto the iris. Large cells may be seen in the anterior chamber, and glaucoma may be present. The diagnosis of epithelial downgrowth can be confirmed by observing the immediate appearance of white spots after medium-power argon laser treatment to the areas of iris covered by the membrane. • Pre-existing uveitis: SEE 12.1, ANTERIOR UVEITIS (IRITIS/IRIDOCYCLITIS). • Sympathetic ophthalmia: Diffuse granulomatous inflammation in both eyes, after trauma or surgery to one eye.

Perform gonioscopy (to evaluate for iris or vitreous to the wound or small retained lens fragments), an IOP measurement, a dilated indirect ophthalmoscopic examination (to rule out retained lens material in the inferior pars plana, retinal detachment, or signs of chorioretinitis), and a posterior vitreous evaluation with a slit lamp and hand-held lens looking for inflammatory cells. \\3. Obtain B-scan US when the fundus view is obscured. Consider UBM if available to assess IOL position, irido-IOL contact for possible UGH syndrome, and to evaluate for retained lens material. \\4. For postoperative endophthalmitis: Anaerobic cultures, using both solid media and broth, should be obtained to isolate P. acnes (routine cultures also are obtained; SEE 12.13, POSTOPERATIVE ENDOPHTHALMITIS ). The anaerobic cultures should be incubated in an anaerobic environment as rapidly as possible and allowed to grow for at least 2 weeks. \\5.

When best corrected acuity is 20/30 or better, glare testing is helpful to demonstrate decreased vision. A dilated slit lamp examination using both direct and retroillumination techniques is required to view the cataract properly. Fundus examination, concentrating on the macula, is essential in ruling out other causes of decreased vision. \\3. For preoperative planning, note the degree of pupil dilation, density of the cataract, and presence or absence of pseudoexfoliation, phacodonesis (quivering of the lens indicating zonular damage or weakness), or cornea guttae. \\4.

OCCLUSIVE VASCULAR DISORDERS Pregnancy represents a hypercoagulable state possibly resulting in the development of retinal artery and vein occlusions, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Ocular DIC is characterized by widespread small-vessel thrombosis, particularly in the choroid, associated with hemorrhage, tissue necrosis, and serous retinal detachments. MENINGIOMA OF PREGNANCY Meningiomas may have a very aggressive growth pattern during pregnancy that is difficult to manage. They may regress postpartum but may reoccur during subsequent pregnancies. NOTE: All pregnant women complaining of a headache should have their blood pressure, visual fields, and fundus checked (particularly looking for papilledema). MRI/MRV or lumbar puncture is often required if a hemorrhage or cortical venous thrombosis is suspected. OTHER CONDITIONS INFLUENCED BY PREGNANCY Multiple conditions can be impacted by pregnancy.

Can also add cycloplegic agent (e.g., atropine 1%) for additional comfort. Consider nightly taping of eyelids. • Consider a tarsorrhaphy, amniotic membrane graft, or Gunderson conjunctival flap in refractory cases. \\2. Uveitis. • Cycloplegia (e.g., atropine 1% b.i.d.). • Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% q1–6h). • Treat uveitis if it is present. SEE 12.1, ANTERIOR UVEITIS (IRITIS/IRIDOCYCLITIS). • Endophthalmitis should be ruled out if severe uveitis or a hypopyon is present. \\3. Markedly increased IOP. • Topical beta-blocker (e.g., timolol 0.5% daily or b.i.d.) with or without an adrenergic agonist (e.g., brimonidine 0.1%, 0.15%, or 0.2% b.i.d. to t.i.d.). Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., dorzolamide 2% t.i.d.) are effective, but potential systemic side effects may not warrant their use for pain relief; miotics and prostaglandin analogues may increase ocular irritation. • If the IOP remains markedly increased and is thought to be responsible for the pain, a cyclodestructive procedure (e.g., diode laser cyclophotocoagulation) may be attempted. The potential for sympathetic ophthalmia must be considered. • If pain persists despite the previously described treatment, a retrobulbar alcohol block may be given. NOTE: Technique: Two to 3 mL of lidocaine is administered in the retrobulbar region. The needle is then held in place while the syringe of lidocaine is replaced with a 1-mL syringe containing 95% to 100% alcohol (some physicians use 50% alcohol). The contents of the alcohol syringe are then injected into the retrobulbar space through the needle. The syringes are again switched, so a small amount of lidocaine can rinse out the remaining alcohol. The retrobulbar needle is then withdrawn. Patients are warned that transient eyelid droop or swelling, limitation of eye movement, or anesthesia may result. Retrobulbar chlorpromazine (25 to 50 mg, using 25 mg/mL) or phenol can also be used. SEE APPENDIX 10, TECHNIQUE FOR RETROBULBAR/SUBTENON/SUBCONJUNCTIVAL INJECTIONS . \\4. Hypotony. • Resolve causes of hypotony (e.g., repair wound leak, treat uveitis or ciliochoroidal detachment). If retinal detachment is found, repair could resolve hypotony. \\5. Cause of pain unknown. • Cycloplegia (e.g., atropine 1% t.i.d.). • Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% q1–6h). • Retrobulbar injections of neurolytic agents can be considered.

Ocular pain refractory to topical medication therapy and/or retrobulbar injections. • Consider enucleation or evisceration of the eye. Evisceration should not be performed if intraocular malignancy is suspected. Enucleation does not relieve facial paresthesias. • Consider history and symptoms for possible causes of postinfectious or postsurgical neuralgia, in which referral to pain management is indicated.

Orbital studies should be obtained using the lowest radiation dose necessary for diagnosis (As Low As Reasonably Acceptable [ALARA]—SEE BELOW). This is especially important in children; for accreditation by the American College of Radiology, health care facilities must maintain specific pediatric protocols for CT. Radiopaque iodinated contrast allows for more extensive evaluation of vascular structures and areas where there is a breakdown of the normal capillary endothelial barrier (as in inflammation).

Always order a dedicated orbital study if ocular or orbital pathology is suspected. Always include views of paranasal sinuses and cavernous sinuses. \\2. Order both direct axial and direct coronal views if older scanners are used. Newer, multidetector (multislice) CT scanners provide excellent views in coronal and parasagittal planes with very short scan times and no patient repositioning. Multidetector CT is preferred when available. \\3. When evaluating traumatic optic neuropathy, request 1-mm cuts of the orbital apex and optic canal to rule out bony impingement of the optic nerve. SEE 3.11, TRAUMATIC OPTIC NEUROPATHY. \\4. When attempting to localize ocular or orbital foreign bodies, order 1-mm cuts. \\5. Intravenous contrast may be necessary for suspected infections or inflammatory conditions. Contrast is helpful in distinguishing orbital cellulitis from abscess. However, it is not mandatory to rule out orbital inflammation or postseptal involvement. Relative contraindications for contrast include renal failure, diabetes, congestive heart failure, multiple myeloma or other proteinemias, sickle cell disease, multiple severe allergies, and asthma. Check renal function and discuss the options with the radiologist for patients in whom renal insufficiency is suspected. Shellfish allergy is not a contraindication for CT contrast. NOTE: The radiologist may recommend premedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines if contrast is required and a prior allergy is suspected. Follow the protocol recommended by your radiology department. \\6. Obtain pregnancy test before obtaining CT scans in females of childbearing age. \\7. CT angiography (CTA) is helpful in diagnosing intracranial vascular pathology, including aneurysms. It is available on all multidetector CT scanners and may be more sensitive than magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in specific clinical situations. However, it requires the use of intravenous iodinated contrast. Also note that CTA requires significantly more radiation than CT. CTA should be avoided if at all possible in children; MRA is the preferred modality in the pediatric age group. \\8. CT scans may be obtained in children with careful consideration of the risk of radiation exposure versus benefits of performing the scan. According to the ALARA paradigm, it is best to avoid CT if possible in children unless there is no reasonable substitute. Check with your radiologist about using a pediatric protocol to limit radiation exposure. Each CT scan exposes children to a cumulative radiation dose that may increase the risk of malignancy over their lifetime. Radiation exposure from CT scans in children is of particular concern when serial imaging is required. In these cases, MRI/MRA is often a better choice for children, although sedation may be needed. NOTE: CT is an extremely valuable tool and is an acceptable imaging modality in children when necessary. Because of its easy availability, rapid scan time, excellent bone resolution, and ability to diagnose acute intracranial hemorrhage, CT is the modality of choice in head and orbital trauma in all age groups, including children. 14.3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/the_wills_eye/:1619:0","tags":["eye"],"title":"The Wills Eye Manual","uri":"/en/the_wills_eye/"},{"categories":["eye"],"content":"Description \\1.

Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is a technique that measures the Brownian motion of water within tissue. Lesions that are tightly packed by cells with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio will minimize Brownian motion and “restrict diffusion.” DWI is often coupled with an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) image. The use of DWI/ADC in the orbit is limited because of proximity of the CNS but can be useful in certain disorders such as lymphoma. Figure 14.3.2. Axial T-1 image with fat suppression and gadolinium.

However, the sensitivity is highly dependent on several factors: hardware, software, availability of adequate clinical history, and the experience of the neuroradiologist. Note that in one large study, the two most critical factors in missing a posterior communicating artery aneurysm on MRI/MRA were lack of clinical history by the referring physician and a reading by a radiologist without fellowship training in neuroradiology. Despite these potential limitations, MRA remains a safe and sensitive screening test, especially when coupled with MRI for concomitant soft tissue imaging.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides noninvasive, noncontact two- or three-dimensional images by measuring optical reflections of light. In this manner, OCT is similar to US except that OCT is based on the reflection of light, not sound. The OCT scanner sends low-coherence light (820-nm wavelength) emitted by a superluminescent diode to the tissue to be examined and to a reference beam. The time delays of the light reflections from retinal structures are recorded by an interferometer. Using a reference mirror, these light reflections are then translated into an imaged object with a high resolution of up to 3 microns. The most highly reflective structures are the nerve fiber layer and the RPE. Highly reflective lesions include dense pigmentation, scar tissue, subhyaloid hemorrhage, neovascularization, and hard exudates. Low-reflectivity in pathologic conditions include areas of edema. Spectral domain OCT has largely replaced time domain OCT due to increased image resolution, shorter acquisition time, and fewer artifacts. Enhanced depth imaging OCT is a technique used to improve the detail of the choroid. Newer modalities such as swept-source OCT and multicolor laser imaging are being evaluated. Swept-source OCT provides better resolution of retinal and choroidal structures within the same scan. Multicolor imaging complements OCT and uses red, green, and blue lasers to provide a topographic map of the outer, mid, and inner retina, respectively.

Anesthetize the eye with a drop of topical anesthetic (e.g., proparacaine) and consider holding a cotton-tipped applicator soaked in the topical anesthetic or applying viscous lidocaine on the involved punctum for several minutes for additional comfort. \\2. Dilate the punctum with a punctum dilator (see Figure A.7.1 ). \\3. Gently insert a #00 Bowman probe into the punctum 2 mm vertically, and then 8 mm horizontally, toward the nose. Avoid using smaller probes, as they can create a false passage. Pull the involved eyelid laterally while slowly moving the probe horizontally to facilitate the procedure and to avoid creating a false passageway. \\4. In the presence of an eyelid laceration, a torn canaliculus may be diagnosed by the appearance of the probe in the site of the eyelid laceration. SEE 3.8, EYELID LACERATION. \\5. Irrigation of the lacrimal system is performed after removing the probe and inserting an irrigation cannula in the same manner in which the probe was inserted. Warn the patient before irrigation to expect a gag reflex. Two to 3 mL of saline is gently pushed into the system. Leakage through a torn eyelid also diagnoses a severed canaliculus. Resistance to injection of the saline, ballooning of the lacrimal sac, or leakage of the saline out of either punctum may be the result of a lacrimal system obstruction. If soft tissue edema occurs during irrigation, stop immediately—a false passage may have been created. A patent lacrimal system usually drains into the throat quite readily, and the arrival of saline may be noted by the patient. Stop irrigating as soon as the patient tastes the fluid. NOTE: If only evaluating the patency of the lacrimal system, and not ruling out a laceration, the system can be irrigated immediately after punctum dilation. *Figure A.7.1* Probing and irrigation: After anesthetizing the eye, dilate the punctum with a punctum dilator. Insert the dilator 2 mm vertically. Pull the eyelid laterally. Rotate the dilator 90 degrees and continue to advance it horizontally. Using a similar insertion technique, advance the irrigation cannula.

A.13 Anterior Chamber Paracentesis \\1. Place a drop of topical anesthetic (e.g., proparacaine) on the surface of the eye. \\2. Retract the eyelids with a sterile speculum. \\3. Place a drop of topical 5% povidone-iodine on the surface of the eye and allow it to sit on the globe at least 30 to 60 seconds. \\4. If available, use an operating microscope or slit lamp. \\5. In an eye with normal or elevated intraocular pressure, fixation forceps are not needed. \\6. In eyes with intraocular pressure \u003c8 mm Hg, fixation forceps may be necessary. Anesthetize the base of the lateral rectus muscle by holding a cotton-tipped applicator dipped in the topical anesthetic against the muscle for 1 minute. Grasp the base of the lateral rectus muscle with fixation forceps at the anesthetized site. NOTE: To best provide countertraction and minimize globe rotation, the eye is fixated at the same side of needle insertion. \\7. Use a 30-gauge short needle on a syringe and remove the plunger. \\8. Enter the eye at an area with a sufficiently formed anterior chamber. Keep the bevel of the needle pointing anteriorly (toward the epithelium) and away from the lens. Keep the tip of the needle over the iris (not the lens) when entering the anterior chamber (see Figure A.13.1 ). NOTE: Make sure the plane of the needle is parallel to the plane of the iris. \\9. Leave the tip of the needle in the anterior chamber for about 2 to 3 seconds. Aqueous will passively egress into the plunger-less syringe. NOTE: In some instances (e.g., when an aqueous specimen is necessary), it may be necessary to withdraw aqueous. This greatly increases the risk of complication and is to be avoided if possible. \\10. Withdraw the needle and place a drop of antibiotic on the eye (e.g., gatifloxacin or moxifloxacin). Consider topical antibiotics q.i.d. for 4 to 7 days. *Figure A.13.1* Anterior chamber paracentesis. A.14 Angle Classification Proper evaluation of the configuration of the anterior chamber requires the use of at least three descriptors: the point at which the peripheral iris is adherent to the cornea or uvea, the depth of the anterior chamber, and the curvature of the peripheral iris. The Spaeth grading system of the anterior chamber angle takes into account all three of these attributes.

First, make note of the most posterior portion of the inner wall of the eye that can be seen without indentation. The iris is then displaced posteriorly by indenting the cornea. This allows determination of the true iris insertion. When the true iris insertion is different from the preindentation appearance, the preindentation appearance is placed in parentheses. For example, a (B)D grade means that without indentation it is not possible to see any of the scleral spur or ciliary body, but with indentation the ciliary body can be seen. *Figure A.14.1* Spaeth angle classification.

A.15 Yag Laser Peripheral Iridotomy Also SEE 9.4, ACUTE ANGLE CLOSURE GLAUCOMA. \\1. Perform pre-laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) gonioscopy to assess baseline angle. \\2. Inform the patient that they may experience ghost imaging after LPI due to the newly created iris defect. Consider creating the LPI at either 3-, 9-, or 12- o’clock (based on physician preference). \\3. Pretreat the eye with one drop each of apraclonidine 1% and pilocarpine (1% for lightly pigmented irides, 2% for darkly pigmented). As an alternative to pilocarpine, some ophthalmologists prefer to shine a bright light into the fellow eye immediately before engaging the laser. This light allows for physiologic constriction of the operative pupil. \\4. Recommended laser settings: • Power: 4 to 7 mJ (usually for a total of 12–21 mJ) • Spot Size: 10 to 70 mm • Shots/pulse: 3 NOTE: Darker irides usually require more total power. Always start with a lower power and titrate up as needed for each individual patient. \\5. Anesthetize the eye (e.g., proparacaine). \\6. Place an Abraham YAG iridotomy contact lens cushioned with 2.5% hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, positioning the magnification button above the anticipated site of iris penetration. NOTE: Keep the lens perpendicular to the YAG beam to ensure good focus and laser concentration. \\7. Focus the YAG beam on the predetermined iris location (see #2, above). Focus within an iris crypt if possible (see Figure A.15.1 ). \\8. Engage the laser. There will be a gush of posterior iris pigment when the iris is completely penetrated. If not penetrated, advance the YAG beam to refocus on the newly created crater. Re-engage the laser until the iris is completely penetrated. \\9. Administer one drop of prednisolone 1% and apraclonidine 1% post-laser. \\10. Check post-LPI intraocular pressure. \\11. Treat inflammation with prednisolone 1% q.i.d. for 4 to 7 days. If the LPI required a significant amount of power (e.g., more than six triple shots), taper the steroids before discontinuation to prevent rebound inflammation. \\12. Have the patient return within 1 to 2 weeks for IOP measurement, iridotomy evaluation, and gonioscopy. *Figure A.15.1* Laser peripheral iridotomy. A.16 Yag Capsulotomy Typically performed for symptomatic posterior capsule opacity in pseudophakic patients (see Figure A.16.1 ). \\1. Assess the pupillary aperture prior to dilation. \\2. Dilate the pupil. \\3. Recommended laser settings: • Power: 1 to 3 mJ • Shots/pulse: 1 • Mode: fundamental mode • Focus: 0 to 1 NOTE: In an effort to minimize total energy, start with a lower power and titrate up as needed. To prevent pitting the intraocular lens, displace or focus the laser beam posteriorly. *Figure A.16.1* YAG capsulotomy. \\4. Anesthetize the eye (e.g., proparacaine). \\5. Consider placing a YAG capsulotomy contact lens cushioned with 2.5% hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. Some prefer to not use a contact lens. \\6. Focus on the posterior lens capsule and engage the laser. Common techniques include a cruciate, circular, or hinged capsulotomy. NOTE: The capsulotomy only needs to be as big as the undilated pupil. \\7.

Escaping Tunnel Vision: Reconsidering Our Best-Laid Career and Life Plans Epilogue Actions for Impact Acknowledgments Notes Illustration Credits Index Prologue After a bumpy flight, fifteen men dropped from the Montana sky. They weren’t skydivers. They were smokejumpers: elite wildland firefighters parachuting in to extinguish a forest fire started by lightning the day before. In a matter of minutes, they would be racing for their lives. The smokejumpers landed near the top of Mann Gulch late on a scorching August afternoon in 1949. With the fire visible across the gulch, they made their way down the slope toward the Missouri River. Their plan was to dig a line in the soil around the fire to contain it and direct it toward an area where there wasn’t much to burn. After hiking about a quarter mile, the foreman, Wagner Dodge, saw that the fire had leapt across the gulch and was heading straight at them. The flames stretched as high as 30 feet in the air.

From an early age, it was clear that Mike was something of an electronics wizard. By the time he turned four, he was building his own record player out of Legos and rubber bands. In high school, when his teachers had broken TVs, they called Mike to fix them. In his spare time, he built a computer and designed a better buzzer for high school quiz-bowl teams, which ended up paying for his first year of college. Just months before finishing his electrical engineering degree, Mike did what so many great entrepreneurs of his era would do: he dropped out of college. It was time for this son of immigrants to make his mark on the world. Mike’s first success came when he patented a device for reading the bar codes on movie film, which was so useful in Hollywood that it won an Emmy and an Oscar for technical achievement. That was small potatoes compared to his next big invention, which made his firm the fastest-growing company on the planet. Mike’s flagship device quickly attracted a cult following, with loyal customers ranging from Bill Gates to Christina Aguilera. “It’s literally changed my life,” Oprah Winfrey gushed. “I cannot live without this.” When he arrived at the White House, President Obama refused to relinquish his to the Secret Service. Mike Lazaridis dreamed up the idea for the BlackBerry as a wireless communication device for sending and receiving emails. As of the summer of 2009, it accounted for nearly half of the U.S. smartphone market. By 2014, its market share had plummeted to less than 1 percent. When a company takes a nosedive like that, we can never pinpoint a single cause of its downfall, so we tend to anthropomorphize it: BlackBerry failed to adapt. Yet adapting to a changing environment isn’t something a company does—it’s something people do in the multitude of decisions they make every day. As the cofounder, president, and co-CEO, Mike was in charge of all the technical and product decisions on the BlackBerry. Although his thinking may have been the spark that ignited the smartphone revolution, his struggles with rethinking ended up sucking the oxygen out of his company and virtually extinguishing his invention. Where did he go wrong? Most of us take pride in our knowledge and expertise, and in staying true to our beliefs and opinions. That makes sense in a stable world, where we get rewarded for having conviction in our ideas. The problem is that we live in a rapidly changing world, where we need to spend as much time rethinking as we do thinking. Rethinking is a skill set, but it’s also a mindset. We already have many of the mental tools we need. We just have to remember to get them out of the shed and remove the rust.

It’s increasing at an increasing rate. In 2011, you consumed about five times as much information per day as you would have just a quarter century earlier. As of 1950, it took about fifty years for knowledge in medicine to double. By 1980, medical knowledge was doubling every seven years, and by 2010, it was doubling in half that time. The accelerating pace of change means that we need to question our beliefs more readily than ever before. This is not an easy task. As we sit with our beliefs, they tend to become more extreme and more entrenched. I’m still struggling to accept that Pluto may not be a planet. In education, after revelations in history and revolutions in science, it often takes years for a curriculum to be updated and textbooks to be revised. Researchers have recently discovered that we need to rethink widely accepted assumptions about such subjects as Cleopatra’s roots (her father was Greek, not Egyptian, and her mother’s identity is unknown); the appearance of dinosaurs (paleontologists now think some tyrannosaurs had colorful feathers on their backs); and what’s required for sight (blind people have actually trained themselves to “see”—sound waves can activate the visual cortex and create representations in the mind’s eye, much like how echolocation helps bats navigate in the dark).* Vintage records, classic cars, and antique clocks might be valuable collectibles, but outdated facts are mental fossils that are best abandoned. We’re swift to recognize when other people need to think again. We question the judgment of experts whenever we seek out a second opinion on a medical diagnosis. Unfortunately, when it comes to our own knowledge and opinions, we often favor feeling right over being right. In everyday life, we make many diagnoses of our own, ranging from whom we hire to whom we marry. We need to develop the habit of forming our own second opinions. Imagine you have a family friend who’s a financial adviser, and he recommends investing in a retirement fund that isn’t in your employer’s plan. You have another friend who’s fairly knowledgeable about investing, and he tells you that this fund is risky. What would you do? When a man named Stephen Greenspan found himself in that situation, he decided to weigh his skeptical friend’s warning against the data available. His sister had been investing in the fund for several years, and she was pleased with the results. A number of her friends had been, too; although the returns weren’t extraordinary, they were consistently in the double digits. The financial adviser was enough of a believer that he had invested his own money in the fund. Armed with that information, Greenspan decided to go forward. He made a bold move, investing nearly a third of his retirement savings in the fund. Before long, he learned that his portfolio had grown by 25 percent. Then he lost it all overnight when the fund collapsed. It was the Ponzi scheme managed by Bernie Madoff. Two decades ago my colleague Phil Tetlock discovered something peculiar. As we think and talk, we often slip into the mindsets of three different professions: preachers, prosecutors, and politicians. In each of these modes, we take on a particular identity and use a distinct set of tools. We go into preacher mode when our sacred beliefs are in jeopardy: we deliver sermons to protect and promote our ideals. We enter prosecutor mode when we recognize flaws in other people’s reasoning: we marshal arguments to prove them wrong and win our case. We shift into politician mode when we’re seeking to win over an audience: we campaign and lobby for the approval of our constituents. The risk is that we become so wrapped up in preaching that we’re right, prosecuting others who are wrong, and politicking for support that we don’t bother to rethink our own views.

You’re paid to be constantly aware of the limits of your understanding. You’re expected to doubt what you know, be curious about what you don’t know, and update your views based on new data. In the past century alone, the application of scientific principles has led to dramatic progress. Biological scientists discovered penicillin. Rocket scientists sent us to the moon. Computer scientists built the internet. But being a scientist is not just a profession. It’s a frame of mind—a mode of thinking that differs from preaching, prosecuting, and politicking. We move into scientist mode when we’re searching for the truth: we run experiments to test hypotheses and discover knowledge. Scientific tools aren’t reserved for people with white coats and beakers, and using them doesn’t require toiling away for years with a microscope and a petri dish. Hypotheses have as much of a place in our lives as they do in the lab. Experiments can inform our daily decisions. That makes me wonder: is it possible to train people in other fields to think more like scientists, and if so, do they end up making smarter choices? Recently, a quartet of European researchers decided to find out. They ran a bold experiment with more than a hundred founders of Italian startups in technology, retail, furniture, food, health care, leisure, and machinery. Most of the founders’ businesses had yet to bring in any revenue, making it an ideal setting to investigate how teaching scientific thinking would influence the bottom line. The entrepreneurs arrived in Milan for a training program in entrepreneurship. Over the course of four months, they learned to create a business strategy, interview customers, build a minimum viable product, and then refine a prototype. What they didn’t know was that they’d been randomly assigned to either a “scientific thinking” group or a control group. The training for both groups was identical, except that one was encouraged to view startups through a scientist’s goggles. From that perspective, their strategy is a theory, customer interviews help to develop hypotheses, and their minimum viable product and prototype are experiments to test those hypotheses. Their task is to rigorously measure the results and make decisions based on whether their hypotheses are supported or refuted. Over the following year, the startups in the control group averaged under $300 in revenue. The startups in the scientific thinking group averaged over $12,000 in revenue. They brought in revenue more than twice as fast—and attracted customers sooner, too. Why? The entrepreneurs in the control group tended to stay wedded to their original strategies and products. It was too easy to preach the virtues of their past decisions, prosecute the vices of alternative options, and politick by catering to advisers who favored the existing direction. The entrepreneurs who had been taught to think like scientists, in contrast, pivoted more than twice as often. When their hypotheses weren’t supported, they knew it was time to rethink their business models. What’s surprising about these results is that we typically celebrate great entrepreneurs and leaders for being strong-minded and clear-sighted. They’re supposed to be paragons of conviction: decisive and certain. Yet evidence reveals that when business executives compete in tournaments to price products, the best strategists are actually slow and unsure. Like careful scientists, they take their time so they have the flexibility to change their minds. I’m beginning to think decisiveness is overrated . . . but I reserve the right to change my mind. Just as you don’t have to be a professional scientist to reason like one, being a professional scientist doesn’t guarantee that someone will use the tools of their training.

No matter how much brainpower you have, if you lack the motivation to change your mind, you’ll miss many occasions to think again. Research reveals that the higher you score on an IQ test, the more likely you are to fall for stereotypes, because you’re faster at recognizing patterns. And recent experiments suggest that the smarter you are, the more you might struggle to update your beliefs. One study investigated whether being a math whiz makes you better at analyzing data. The answer is yes—if you’re told the data are about something bland, like a treatment for skin rashes. But what if the exact same data are labeled as focusing on an ideological issue that activates strong emotions—like gun laws in the United States? Being a quant jock makes you more accurate in interpreting the results—as long as they support your beliefs. Yet if the empirical pattern clashes with your ideology, math prowess is no longer an asset; it actually becomes a liability. The better you are at crunching numbers, the more spectacularly you fail at analyzing patterns that contradict your views. If they were liberals, math geniuses did worse than their peers at evaluating evidence that gun bans failed. If they were conservatives, they did worse at assessing evidence that gun bans worked. In psychology there are at least two biases that drive this pattern. One is confirmation bias: seeing what we expect to see. The other is desirability bias: seeing what we want to see. These biases don’t just prevent us from applying our intelligence. They can actually contort our intelligence into a weapon against the truth. We find reasons to preach our faith more deeply, prosecute our case more passionately, and ride the tidal wave of our political party. The tragedy is that we’re usually unaware of the resulting flaws in our thinking. My favorite bias is the “I’m not biased” bias, in which people believe they’re more objective than others. It turns out that smart people are more likely to fall into this trap. The brighter you are, the harder it can be to see your own limitations. Being good at thinking can make you worse at rethinking. When we’re in scientist mode, we refuse to let our ideas become ideologies. We don’t start with answers or solutions; we lead with questions and puzzles. We don’t preach from intuition; we teach from evidence. We don’t just have healthy skepticism about other people’s arguments; we dare to disagree with our own arguments. Thinking like a scientist involves more than just reacting with an open mind. It means being actively open-minded. It requires searching for reasons why we might be wrong—not for reasons why we must be right—and revising our views based on what we learn. That rarely happens in the other mental modes. In preacher mode, changing our minds is a mark of moral weakness; in scientist mode, it’s a sign of intellectual integrity. In prosecutor mode, allowing ourselves to be persuaded is admitting defeat; in scientist mode, it’s a step toward the truth. In politician mode, we flip-flop in response to carrots and sticks; in scientist mode, we shift in the face of sharper logic and stronger data. I’ve done my best to write this book in scientist mode.* I’m a teacher, not a preacher. I can’t stand politics, and I hope a decade as a tenured professor has cured me of whatever temptation I once felt to appease my audience. Although I’ve spent more than my share of time in prosecutor mode, I’ve decided that in a courtroom I’d rather be the judge. I don’t expect you to agree with everything I think. My hope is that you’ll be intrigued by how I think—and that the studies, stories, and ideas covered here will lead you to do some rethinking of your own. After all, the purpose of learning isn’t to affirm our beliefs; it’s to evolve our beliefs. One of my beliefs is that we shouldn’t be open-minded in every circumstance.

It starts with intellectual humility—knowing what we don’t know. We should all be able to make a long list of areas where we’re ignorant. Mine include art, financial markets, fashion, chemistry, food, why British accents turn American in songs, and why it’s impossible to tickle yourself. Recognizing our shortcomings opens the door to doubt. As we question our current understanding, we become curious about what information we’re missing. That search leads us to new discoveries, which in turn maintain our humility by reinforcing how much we still have to learn. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don’t know is wisdom. Scientific thinking favors humility over pride, doubt over certainty, curiosity over closure. When we shift out of scientist mode, the rethinking cycle breaks down, giving way to an overconfidence cycle. If we’re preaching, we can’t see gaps in our knowledge: we believe we’ve already found the truth. Pride breeds conviction rather than doubt, which makes us prosecutors: we might be laser-focused on changing other people’s minds, but ours is set in stone. That launches us into confirmation bias and desirability bias. We become politicians, ignoring or dismissing whatever doesn’t win the favor of our constituents—our parents, our bosses, or the high school classmates we’re still trying to impress. We become so busy putting on a show that the truth gets relegated to a backstage seat, and the resulting validation can make us arrogant. We fall victim to the fat-cat syndrome, resting on our laurels instead of pressure-testing our beliefs. In the case of the BlackBerry, Mike Lazaridis was trapped in an overconfidence cycle. Taking pride in his successful invention gave him too much conviction. Nowhere was that clearer than in his preference for the keyboard over a touchscreen. It was a BlackBerry virtue he loved to preach—and an Apple vice he was quick to prosecute. As his company’s stock fell, Mike got caught up in confirmation bias and desirability bias, and fell victim to validation from fans. “It’s an iconic product,” he said of the BlackBerry in 2011. “It’s used by business, it’s used by leaders, it’s used by celebrities.” By 2012, the iPhone had captured a quarter of the global smartphone market, but Mike was still resisting the idea of typing on glass. “I don’t get this,” he said at a board meeting, pointing at a phone with a touchscreen. “The keyboard is one of the reasons they buy BlackBerrys.” Like a politician who campaigns only to his base, he focused on the keyboard taste of millions of existing users, neglecting the appeal of a touchscreen to billions of potential users. For the record, I still miss the keyboard, and I’m excited that it’s been licensed for an attempted comeback. When Mike finally started reimagining the screen and software, some of his engineers didn’t want to abandon their past work. The failure to rethink was widespread. In 2011, an anonymous high-level employee inside the firm wrote an open letter to Mike and his co-CEO. “We laughed and said they are trying to put a computer on a phone, that it won’t work,” the letter read. “We are now 3–4 years too late.” Our convictions can lock us in prisons of our own making. The solution is not to decelerate our thinking—it’s to accelerate our rethinking. That’s what resurrected Apple from the brink of bankruptcy to become the world’s most valuable company. The legend of Apple’s renaissance revolves around the lone genius of Steve Jobs. It was his conviction and clarity of vision, the story goes, that gave birth to the iPhone. The reality is that he was dead-set against the mobile phone category. His employees had the vision for it, and it was their ability to change his mind that really revived Apple. Although Jobs knew how to “think different,” it was his team that did much of the rethinking.

Over the following month her condition deteriorated. She struggled to locate the glass of water she put next to her bed. She couldn’t find the door to her room. She walked directly into her bed frame. Ursula was a seamstress in her midfifties, and she hadn’t lost her dexterity: she was able to cut different shapes out of paper with scissors. She could easily point to her nose, mouth, arms, and legs, and had no difficulty describing her home and her pets. For an Austrian doctor named Gabriel Anton, she presented a curious case. When Anton put a red ribbon and scissors on the table in front of her, she couldn’t name them, even though “she confirmed, calmly and faithfully, that she could see the presented objects.” She was clearly having problems with language production, which she acknowledged, and with spatial orientation. Yet something else was wrong: Ursula could no longer tell the difference between light and dark. When Anton held up an object and asked her to describe it, she didn’t even try to look at it but instead reached out to touch it. Tests showed that her eyesight was severely impaired. Oddly, when Anton asked her about the deficit, she insisted she could see. Eventually, when she lost her vision altogether, she remained completely unaware of it. “It was now extremely astonishing,” Anton wrote, “that the patient did not notice her massive and later complete loss of her ability to see . . . she was mentally blind to her blindness.” It was the late 1800s, and Ursula wasn’t alone. A decade earlier a neuropathologist in Zurich had reported a case of a man who suffered an accident that left him blind but was unaware of it despite being “intellectually unimpaired.” Although he didn’t blink when a fist was placed in front of his face and couldn’t see the food on his plate, “he thought he was in a dark humid hole or cellar.” Half a century later, a pair of doctors reported six cases of people who had gone blind but claimed otherwise. “One of the most striking features in the behavior of our patients was their inability to learn from their experiences,” the doctors wrote: As they were not aware of their blindness when they walked about, they bumped into the furniture and walls but did not change their behavior. When confronted with their blindness in a rather pointed fashion, they would either deny any visual difficulty or remark: “It is so dark in the room; why don’t they turn the light on?”; “I forgot my glasses,” or “My vision is not too good, but I can see all right.” The patients would not accept any demonstration or assurance which would prove their blindness. This phenomenon was first described by the Roman philosopher Seneca, who wrote of a woman who was blind but complained that she was simply in a dark room. It’s now accepted in the medical literature as Anton’s syndrome—a deficit of self-awareness in which a person is oblivious to a physical disability but otherwise doing fairly well cognitively. It’s known to be caused by damage to the occipital lobe of the brain. Yet I’ve come to believe that even when our brains are functioning normally, we’re all vulnerable to a version of Anton’s syndrome. We all have blind spots in our knowledge and opinions. The bad news is that they can leave us blind to our blindness, which gives us false confidence in our judgment and prevents us from rethinking. The good news is that with the right kind of confidence, we can learn to see ourselves more clearly and update our views. In driver’s training we were taught to identify our visual blind spots and eliminate them with the help of mirrors and sensors. In life, since our minds don’t come equipped with those tools, we need to learn to recognize our cognitive blind spots and ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:5:0","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"A TALE OF TWO SYNDROMES On the first day of December 2015, Halla Tómasdóttir got a call she never expected. The roof of Halla’s house had just given way to a thick layer of snow and ice. As she watched water pouring down one of the walls, the friend on the other end of the line asked if Halla had seen the Facebook posts about her. Someone had started a petition for Halla to run for the presidency of Iceland. Halla’s first thought was, Who am I to be president? She had helped start a university and then cofounded an investment firm in 2007. When the 2008 financial crisis rocked the world, Iceland was hit particularly hard; all three of its major private commercial banks defaulted and its currency collapsed. Relative to the size of its economy, the country faced the worst financial meltdown in human history, but Halla demonstrated her leadership skills by guiding her firm successfully through the crisis. Even with that accomplishment, she didn’t feel prepared for the presidency. She had no political background; she had never served in government or in any kind of public-sector role. It wasn’t the first time Halla had felt like an impostor. At the age of eight, her piano teacher had placed her on a fast track and frequently asked her to play in concerts, but she never felt she was worthy of the honor—and so, before every concert, she felt sick. Although the stakes were much higher now, the self-doubt felt familiar. “I had a massive pit in my stomach, like the piano recital but much bigger,” Halla told me. “It’s the worst case of adult impostor syndrome I’ve ever had.” For months, she struggled with the idea of becoming a candidate. As her friends and family encouraged her to recognize that she had some relevant skills, Halla was still convinced that she lacked the necessary experience and confidence. She tried to persuade other women to run—one of whom ended up ascending to a different office, as the prime minister of Iceland. Yet the petition didn’t go away, and Halla’s friends, family, and colleagues didn’t stop urging her on. Eventually, she found herself asking, Who am I not to serve? She ultimately decided to go for it, but the odds were heavily stacked against her. She was running as an unknown independent candidate in a field of more than twenty contenders. One of her competitors was particularly powerful—and particularly dangerous. When an economist was asked to name the three people most responsible for Iceland’s bankruptcy, she nominated Davíð Oddsson for all three spots. As Iceland’s prime minister from 1991 to 2004, Oddsson put the country’s banks in jeopardy by privatizing them. Then, as governor of Iceland’s central bank from 2005 to 2009, he allowed the banks’ balance sheets to balloon to more than ten times the national GDP. When the people protested his mismanagement, Oddsson refused to resign and had to be forced out by Parliament. Time magazine later identified him as one of the twenty-five people to blame for the financial crisis worldwide. Nevertheless, in 2016 Oddsson announced his candidacy for the presidency of Iceland: “My experience and knowledge, which is considerable, could go well with this office.” In theory, confidence and competence go hand in hand. In practice, they often diverge. You can see it when people rate their own leadership skills and are also evaluated by their colleagues, supervisors, or subordinates. In a meta-analysis of ninety-five studies involving over a hundred thousand people, women typically underestimated their leadership skills, while men overestimated their skills. You’ve probably met some football fans who are convinced they know more than the coaches on the sidelines. That’s the armchair quarterback syndrome, where confidence exceeds competence. Even after calling financial plays that destroyed an economy, Davíð Oddsson still refused to acknowledge that he wasn’t qualified to coach—let alone quarterback. He was blind to his weaknesses.

It’s called the Ig™ Nobel Prize, and it’s handed out by actual Nobel laureates. One autumn in college, I raced to the campus theater to watch the ceremony along with over a thousand fellow nerds. The winners included a pair of physicists who created a magnetic field to levitate a live frog, a trio of chemists who discovered that the biochemistry of romantic love has something in common with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a computer scientist who invented PawSense—software that detects cat paws on a keyboard and makes an annoying noise to deter them. Unclear whether it also worked with dogs. Several of the awards made me laugh, but the honorees who made me think the most were two psychologists, David Dunning and Justin Kruger. They had just published a “modest report” on skill and confidence that would soon become famous. They found that in many situations, those who can’t . . . don’t know they can’t. According to what’s now known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, it’s when we lack competence that we’re most likely to be brimming with overconfidence. In the original Dunning-Kruger studies, people who scored the lowest on tests of logical reasoning, grammar, and sense of humor had the most inflated opinions of their skills. On average, they believed they did better than 62 percent of their peers, but in reality outperformed only 12 percent of them. The less intelligent we are in a particular domain, the more we seem to overestimate our actual intelligence in that domain. In a group of football fans, the one who knows the least is the most likely to be the armchair quarterback, prosecuting the coach for calling the wrong play and preaching about a better playbook. This tendency matters because it compromises self-awareness, and it trips us up across all kinds of settings. Look what happened when economists evaluated the operations and management practices of thousands of companies across a wide range of industries and countries, and compared their assessments with managers’ self-ratings: Sources: World Management Survey; Bloom and Van Reenen 2007; and Maloney 2017b. In this graph, if self-assessments of performance matched actual performance, every country would be on the dotted line. Overconfidence existed in every culture, and it was most rampant where management was the poorest.* Of course, management skills can be hard to judge objectively. Knowledge should be easier—you were tested on yours throughout school. Compared to most people, how much do you think you know about each of the following topics—more, less, or the same? Why English became the official language of the United States Why women were burned at the stake in Salem What job Walt Disney had before he drew Mickey Mouse On which spaceflight humans first laid eyes on the Great Wall of China Why eating candy affects how kids behave One of my biggest pet peeves is feigned knowledge, where people pretend to know things they don’t. It bothers me so much that at this very moment I’m writing an entire book about it. In a series of studies, people rated whether they knew more or less than most people about a range of topics like these, and then took a quiz to test their actual knowledge. The more superior participants thought their knowledge was, the more they overestimated themselves—and the less interested they were in learning and updating. If you think you know more about history or science than most people, chances are you know less than you think. As Dunning quips, “The first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don’t know you’re a member of the Dunning-Kruger club.”* On the questions above, if you felt you knew anything at all, think again.

If we’re certain that we know something, we have no reason to look for gaps and flaws in our knowledge—let alone fill or correct them. In one study, the people who scored the lowest on an emotional intelligence test weren’t just the most likely to overestimate their skills. They were also the most likely to dismiss their scores as inaccurate or irrelevant—and the least likely to invest in coaching or self-improvement. Yes, some of this comes down to our fragile egos. We’re driven to deny our weaknesses when we want to see ourselves in a positive light or paint a glowing picture of ourselves to others. A classic case is the crooked politician who claims to crusade against corruption, but is actually motivated by willful blindness or social deception. Yet motivation is only part of the story.* There’s a less obvious force that clouds our vision of our abilities: a deficit in metacognitive skill, the ability to think about our thinking. Lacking competence can leave us blind to our own incompetence. If you’re a tech entrepreneur and you’re uninformed about education systems, you can feel certain that your master plan will fix them. If you’re socially awkward and you’re missing some insight on social graces, you can strut around believing you’re James Bond. In high school, a friend told me I didn’t have a sense of humor. What made her think that? “You don’t laugh at all my jokes.” I’m hilarious . . . said no funny person ever. I’ll leave it to you to decide who lacked the sense of humor. When we lack the knowledge and skills to achieve excellence, we sometimes lack the knowledge and skills to judge excellence. This insight should immediately put your favorite confident ignoramuses in their place. Before we poke fun at them, though, it’s worth remembering that we all have moments when we are them. We’re all novices at many things, but we’re not always blind to that fact. We tend to overestimate ourselves on desirable skills, like the ability to carry on a riveting conversation. We’re also prone to overconfidence in situations where it’s easy to confuse experience for expertise, like driving, typing, trivia, and managing emotions. Yet we underestimate ourselves when we can easily recognize that we lack experience—like painting, driving a race car, and rapidly reciting the alphabet backward. Absolute beginners rarely fall into the Dunning-Kruger trap. If you don’t know a thing about football, you probably don’t walk around believing you know more than the coach. It’s when we progress from novice to amateur that we become overconfident. A bit of knowledge can be a dangerous thing. In too many domains of our lives, we never gain enough expertise to question our opinions or discover what we don’t know. We have just enough information to feel self-assured about making pronouncements and passing judgment, failing to realize that we’ve climbed to the top of Mount Stupid without making it over to the other side. You can see this phenomenon in one of Dunning’s experiments that involved people playing the role of doctors in a simulated zombie apocalypse. When they’ve seen only a handful of injured victims, their perceived and actual skills match. Unfortunately, as they gain experience, their confidence climbs faster than their competence, and confidence remains higher than competence from that point on. This might be one of the reasons that patient mortality rates in hospitals seem to spike in July, when new residents take over. It’s not their lack of skill alone that proves hazardous; it’s their overestimation of that skill. Advancing from novice to amateur can break the rethinking cycle. As we gain experience, we lose some of our humility. We take pride in making rapid progress, which promotes a false sense of mastery. That jump-starts an overconfidence cycle, preventing us from doubting what we know and being cur","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:5:3","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"WHAT GOLDILOCKS GOT WRONG Many people picture confidence as a seesaw. Gain too much confidence, and we tip toward arrogance. Lose too much confidence, and we become meek. This is our fear with humility: that we’ll end up having a low opinion of ourselves. We want to keep the seesaw balanced, so we go into Goldilocks mode and look for the amount of confidence that’s just right. Recently, though, I learned that this is the wrong approach. Humility is often misunderstood. It’s not a matter of having low self-confidence. One of the Latin roots of humility means “from the earth.” It’s about being grounded—recognizing that we’re flawed and fallible. Confidence is a measure of how much you believe in yourself. Evidence shows that’s distinct from how much you believe in your methods. You can be confident in your ability to achieve a goal in the future while maintaining the humility to question whether you have the right tools in the present. That’s the sweet spot of confidence. We become blinded by arrogance when we’re utterly convinced of our strengths and our strategies. We get paralyzed by doubt when we lack conviction in both. We can be consumed by an inferiority complex when we know the right method but feel uncertain about our ability to execute it. What we want to attain is confident humility: having faith in our capability while appreciating that we may not have the right solution or even be addressing the right problem. That gives us enough doubt to reexamine our old knowledge and enough confidence to pursue new insights. When Spanx founder Sara Blakely had the idea for footless pantyhose, she believed in her ability to make the idea a reality, but she was full of doubt about her current tools. Her day job was selling fax machines door-to-door, and she was aware that she didn’t know anything about fashion, retail, or manufacturing. When she was designing the prototype, she spent a week driving around to hosiery mills to ask them for help. When she couldn’t afford a law firm to apply for a patent, she read a book on the topic and filled out the application herself. Her doubt wasn’t debilitating—she was confident she could overcome the challenges in front of her. Her confidence wasn’t in her existing knowledge—it was in her capacity to learn. Confident humility can be taught. In one experiment, when students read a short article about the benefits of admitting what we don’t know rather than being certain about it, their odds of seeking extra help in an area of weakness spiked from 65 to 85 percent. They were also more likely to explore opposing political views to try to learn from the other side. Confident humility doesn’t just open our minds to rethinking—it improves the quality of our rethinking. In college and graduate school, students who are willing to revise their beliefs get higher grades than their peers. In high school, students who admit when they don’t know something are rated by teachers as learning more effectively and by peers as contributing more to their teams. At the end of the academic year, they have significantly higher math grades than their more self-assured peers. Instead of just assuming they’ve mastered the material, they quiz themselves to test their understanding. When adults have the confidence to acknowledge what they don’t know, they pay more attention to how strong evidence is and spend more time reading material that contradicts their opinions. In rigorous studies of leadership effectiveness across the United States and China, the most productive and innovative teams aren’t run by leaders who are confident or humble. The most effective leaders score high in both confidence and humility. Although they have faith in their strengths, they’re also keenly aware of their weaknesses. They know they need to recognize and transcend their limits if they want to push the limits of greatness. If we care about accuracy, we can’t afford to have blind spots.

To focus on the most promising candidates, the network airing the first televised debate announced that they wouldn’t feature anyone with less than 2.5 percent of the vote. On the day of the debate, Halla ended up barely squeaking through. Over the following month her popularity skyrocketed. She wasn’t just a viable candidate; she was in the final four. A few years later, when I invited her to speak to my class, Halla mentioned that the psychological fuel that propelled her meteoric rise was none other than impostor syndrome. Feeling like an impostor is typically viewed as a bad thing, and for good reason—a chronic sense of being unworthy can breed misery, crush motivation, and hold us back from pursuing our ambitions. From time to time, though, a less crippling sense of doubt waltzes into many of our minds. Some surveys suggest that more than half the people you know have felt like impostors at some point in their careers. It’s thought to be especially common among women and marginalized groups. Strangely, it also seems to be particularly pronounced among high achievers. I’ve taught students who earned patents before they could drink and became chess masters before they could drive, but these same individuals still wrestle with insecurity and constantly question their abilities. The standard explanation for their accomplishments is that they succeed in spite of their doubts, but what if their success is actually driven in part by those doubts? To find out, Basima Tewfik—then a doctoral student at Wharton, now an MIT professor—recruited a group of medical students who were preparing to begin their clinical rotations. She had them interact for more than half an hour with actors who had been trained to play the role of patients presenting symptoms of various diseases. Basima observed how the medical students treated the patients—and also tracked whether they made the right diagnoses. A week earlier the students had answered a survey about how often they entertained impostor thoughts like I am not as qualified as others think I am and People important to me think I am more capable than I think I am. Those who self-identified as impostors didn’t do any worse in their diagnoses, and they did significantly better when it came to bedside manner—they were rated as more empathetic, respectful, and professional, as well as more effective in asking questions and sharing information. In another study, Basima found a similar pattern with investment professionals: the more often they felt like impostors, the higher their performance reviews from their supervisors four months later. This evidence is new, and we still have a lot to learn about when impostor syndrome is beneficial versus when it’s detrimental. Still, it leaves me wondering if we’ve been misjudging impostor syndrome by seeing it solely as a disorder. When our impostor fears crop up, the usual advice is to ignore them—give ourselves the benefit of the doubt. Instead, we might be better off embracing those fears, because they can give us three benefits of doubt. The first upside of feeling like an impostor is that it can motivate us to work harder. It’s probably not helpful when we’re deciding whether to start a race, but once we’ve stepped up to the starting line, it gives us the drive to keep running to the end so that we can earn our place among the finalists.* In some of my own research across call centers, military and government teams, and nonprofits, I’ve found that confidence can make us complacent. If we never worry about letting other people down, we’re more likely to actually do so. When we feel like impostors, we think we have something to prove. Impostors may be the last to jump in, but they may also be the last to bail out. Second, impostor thoughts can motivate us to work smarter. When we don’t believe we’re going to win, we","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:5:5","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY HUMILITY When I sat down with Halla, she told me that in the past her doubts had been debilitating. She took them as a sign that she lacked the ability to succeed. Now she had reached a point of confident humility, and she interpreted doubts differently: they were a cue that she needed to improve her tools. Plenty of evidence suggests that confidence is just as often the result of progress as the cause of it. We don’t have to wait for our confidence to rise to achieve challenging goals. We can build it through achieving challenging goals. “I have come to welcome impostor syndrome as a good thing: it’s fuel to do more, try more,” Halla says. “I’ve learned to use it to my advantage. I actually thrive on the growth that comes from the self-doubt.” While other candidates were content to rely on the usual media coverage, Halla’s uncertainty about her tools made her eager to rethink the way campaigns were run. She worked harder and smarter, staying up late to personally answer social media messages. She held Facebook Live sessions where voters could ask her anything, and learned to use Snapchat to reach young people. Deciding she had nothing to lose, she went where few presidential candidates had gone before: instead of prosecuting her opponents, she ran a positive campaign. How much worse can it get? she thought. It was part of why she resonated so strongly with voters: they were tired of watching candidates smear one another and delighted to see a candidate treat her competitors with respect. Uncertainty primes us to ask questions and absorb new ideas. It protects us against the Dunning-Kruger effect. “Impostor syndrome always keeps me on my toes and growing because I never think I know it all,” Halla reflects, sounding more like a scientist than a politician. “Maybe impostor syndrome is needed for change. Impostors rarely say, ‘This is how we do things around here.’ They don’t say, ‘This is the right way.’ I was so eager to learn and grow that I asked everyone for advice on how I could do things differently.” Although she doubted her tools, she had confidence in herself as a learner. She understood that knowledge is best sought from experts, but creativity and wisdom can come from anywhere. Iceland’s presidential election came down to Halla, Davíð Oddsson, and two other men. The three men all enjoyed more media coverage than Halla throughout the campaign, including front-page interviews, which she never received. They also had bigger campaign budgets. Yet on election day, Halla stunned her country—and herself—by winning more than a quarter of the vote. She didn’t land the presidency; she came in second. Her 28 percent fell shy of the victor’s 39 percent. But Halla trounced Davíð Oddsson, who finished fourth, with less than 14 percent. Based on her trajectory and momentum, it’s not crazy to imagine that with a few more weeks, she could have won. Great thinkers don’t harbor doubts because they’re impostors. They maintain doubts because they know we’re all partially blind and they’re committed to improving their sight. They don’t boast about how much they know; they marvel at how little they understand. They’re aware that each answer raises new questions, and the quest for knowledge is never finished. A mark of lifelong learners is recognizing that they can learn something from everyone they meet. Arrogance leaves us blind to our weaknesses. Humility is a reflective lens: it helps us see them clearly. Confident humility is a corrective lens: it enables us to overcome those weaknesses.

Whenever I’m wrong, the world makes a little less sense. —dr. frasier crane, played by kelsey grammer In the fall of 1959, a prominent psychologist welcomed new participants into a wildly unethical study. He had handpicked a group of Harvard sophomores to join a series of experiments that would run through the rest of their time in college. The students volunteered to spend a couple of hours a week contributing to knowledge about how personality develops and how psychological problems can be solved. They had no idea that they were actually signing up to have their beliefs attacked. The researcher, Henry Murray, had originally trained as a physician and biochemist. After becoming a distinguished psychologist, he was disillusioned that his field paid little attention to how people navigate difficult interactions, so he decided to create them in his own lab. He gave students a month to write out their personal philosophy of life, including their core values and guiding principles. When they showed up to submit their work, they were paired with another student who had done the same exercise. They would have a day or two to read each other’s philosophies, and then they would be filmed debating them. The experience would be much more intense than they anticipated. Murray modeled the study on psychological assessments he had developed for spies in World War II. As a lieutenant colonel, Murray had been recruited to vet potential agents for the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA. To gauge how candidates would handle pressure, he sent them down to a basement to be interrogated with a bright light shining in their faces. The examiner would wait for an inconsistency in their accounts to pop up and then scream, “You’re a liar!” Some candidates quit on the spot; others were reduced to tears. Those who withstood the onslaught got the gig. Now Murray was ready for a more systematic study of reactions to stress. He had carefully screened students to create a sample that included a wide range of personalities and mental health profiles. He gave them code names based on their character traits, including Drill, Quartz, Locust, Hinge, and Lawful—more on him later. When students arrived for the debate, they discovered that their sparring partner was not a peer but a law student. What they didn’t know was that the law student was in cahoots with the research team: his task was to spend eighteen minutes launching an aggressive assault on their worldviews. Murray called it a “stressful interpersonal disputation,” having directed the law student to make the participants angry and anxious with a “mode of attack” that was “vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive.” The poor students sweated and shouted as they struggled to defend their ideals. The pain didn’t stop there. In the weeks that followed, the students were invited back to the lab to discuss the films of their own interactions. They watched themselves grimacing and stringing together incoherent sentences. All in all, they spent about eight hours reliving those humiliating eighteen minutes. A quarter century later, when the participants reflected on the experience, it was clear that many had found it agonizing. Drill described feeling “unabating rage.” Locust recalled his bewilderment, anger, chagrin, and discomfort. “They have deceived me, telling me there was going to be a discussion, when in fact there was an attack,” he wrote. “How could they have done this to me; what is the point of this?” Other participants had a strikingly different response: they actually seemed to get a kick out of being forced to rethink their beliefs. “Some may have found the experience mildly discomforting, in that their cherished (and in my case, at least, sophomoric) philosophies were challenged in an aggressive manner,” one participant remembers. “But it was hardly an experience that would blight one for a week, le","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:8:0","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"THE DICTATOR POLICING YOUR THOUGHTS When our son was five, he was excited to learn that his uncle was expecting a child. My wife and I both predicted a boy, and so did our son. A few weeks later, we found out the baby would be a girl. When we broke the news to our son, he burst into tears. “Why are you crying?” I asked. “Is it because you were hoping your new cousin would be a boy?” “No!” he shouted, pounding his fists on the floor. “Because we were wrong!” I explained that being wrong isn’t always a bad thing. It can be a sign that we’ve learned something new—and that discovery itself can be a delight. This realization didn’t come naturally to me. Growing up, I was determined to be right. In second grade I corrected my teacher for misspelling the word lightning as lightening. When trading baseball cards I would rattle off statistics from recent games as proof that the price guide was valuing players inaccurately. My friends found this annoying and started calling me Mr. Facts. It got so bad that one day my best friend announced that he wouldn’t talk to me until I admitted I was wrong. It was the beginning of my journey to become more accepting of my own fallibility. In a classic paper, sociologist Murray Davis argued that when ideas survive, it’s not because they’re true—it’s because they’re interesting. What makes an idea interesting is that it challenges our weakly held opinions. Did you know that the moon might originally have formed inside a vaporous Earth out of magma rain? That a narwhal’s tusk is actually a tooth? When an idea or assumption doesn’t matter deeply to us, we’re often excited to question it. The natural sequence of emotions is surprise (“Really?”) followed by curiosity (“Tell me more!”) and thrill (“Whoa!”). To paraphrase a line attributed to Isaac Asimov, great discoveries often begin not with “Eureka!” but with “That’s funny . . .” When a core belief is questioned, though, we tend to shut down rather than open up. It’s as if there’s a miniature dictator living inside our heads, controlling the flow of facts to our minds, much like Kim Jong-un controls the press in North Korea. The technical term for this in psychology is the totalitarian ego, and its job is to keep out threatening information. It’s easy to see how an inner dictator comes in handy when someone attacks our character or intelligence. Those kinds of personal affronts threaten to shatter aspects of our identities that are important to us and might be difficult to change. The totalitarian ego steps in like a bodyguard for our minds, protecting our self-image by feeding us comforting lies. They’re all just jealous. You’re really, really, ridiculously good-looking. You’re on the verge of inventing the next Pet Rock. As physicist Richard Feynman quipped, “You must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.” Our inner dictator also likes to take charge when our deeply held opinions are threatened. In the Harvard study of attacking students’ worldviews, the participant who had the strongest negative reaction was code-named Lawful. He came from a blue-collar background and was unusually precocious, having started college at sixteen and joined the study at seventeen. One of his beliefs was that technology was harming civilization, and he became hostile when his views were questioned. Lawful went on to become an academic, and when he penned his magnum opus, it was clear that he hadn’t changed his mind. His concerns about technology had only intensified: The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities . . . to physical suffering as well . . . and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. That kind of conviction is a common response to threats.

I was studying whether generous, selfish, or fair people were more productive in jobs like sales and engineering. One of the attendees was Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel Prize–winning psychologist who has spent much of his career demonstrating how flawed our intuitions are. He told me afterward that he was surprised by my finding that givers had higher rates of failure than takers and matchers—but higher rates of success, too. When you read a study that surprises you, how do you react? Many people would get defensive, searching for flaws in the study’s design or the statistical analysis. Danny did the opposite. His eyes lit up, and a huge grin appeared on his face. “That was wonderful,” he said. “I was wrong.” Later, I sat down with Danny for lunch and asked him about his reaction. It looked a lot to me like the joy of being wrong—his eyes twinkled as if he was having fun. He said that in his eighty-five years, no one had pointed that out before, but yes, he genuinely enjoys discovering that he was wrong, because it means he is now less wrong than before. I knew the feeling. In college, what first attracted me to social science was reading studies that clashed with my expectations; I couldn’t wait to tell my roommates about all the assumptions I’d been rethinking. In my first independent research project, I tested some predictions of my own, and more than a dozen of my hypotheses turned out to be false.* It was a major lesson in intellectual humility, but I wasn’t devastated. I felt an immediate rush of excitement. Discovering I was wrong felt joyful because it meant I’d learned something. As Danny told me, “Being wrong is the only way I feel sure I’ve learned anything.” Danny isn’t interested in preaching, prosecuting, or politicking. He’s a scientist devoted to the truth. When I asked him how he stays in that mode, he said he refuses to let his beliefs become part of his identity. “I change my mind at a speed that drives my collaborators crazy,” he explained. “My attachment to my ideas is provisional. There’s no unconditional love for them.” Attachment. That’s what keeps us from recognizing when our opinions are off the mark and rethinking them. To unlock the joy of being wrong, we need to detach. I’ve learned that two kinds of detachment are especially useful: detaching your present from your past and detaching your opinions from your identity. Let’s start with detaching your present from your past. In psychology, one way of measuring the similarity between the person you are right now and your former self is to ask: which pair of circles best describes how you see yourself? In the moment, separating your past self from your current self can be unsettling. Even positive changes can lead to negative emotions; evolving your identity can leave you feeling derailed and disconnected. Over time, though, rethinking who you are appears to become mentally healthy—as long as you can tell a coherent story about how you got from past to present you. In one study, when people felt detached from their past selves, they became less depressed over the course of the year. When you feel as if your life is changing direction, and you’re in the process of shifting who you are, it’s easier to walk away from foolish beliefs you once held. My past self was Mr. Facts—I was too fixated on knowing. Now I’m more interested in finding out what I don’t know. As Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio told me, “If you don’t look back at yourself and think, ‘Wow, how stupid I was a year ago,’ then you must not have learned much in the last year.” The second kind of detachment is separating your opinions from your identity. I’m guessing you wouldn’t want to see a doctor whose identity is Professional Lobotomist, send your kids to a teacher whose identity is Corporal Punisher, or live in a town where the police chief’s identity is Stop-and-Frisker.

He’s in his late forties, and he’s the sort of person who’s honest to a fault; he tells the truth even if it hurts. When his son was a toddler, they were watching a space documentary together, and Jean-Pierre casually mentioned that the sun would one day turn into a red giant and engulf the Earth. His son was not amused. Between tears, he cried, “But I love this planet!” Jean-Pierre felt so terrible that he decided to bite his tongue instead of mentioning threats that could prevent the Earth from even lasting that long. Back in the 1990s, Jean-Pierre had a hobby of collecting the predictions that pundits made on the news and scoring his own forecasts against them. Eventually he started competing in forecasting tournaments—international contests hosted by Good Judgment, where people try to predict the future. It’s a daunting task; there’s an old saying that historians can’t even predict the past. A typical tournament draws thousands of entrants from around the world to anticipate big political, economic, and technological events. The questions are time-bound, with measurable, specific results. Will the current president of Iran still be in office in six months? Which soccer team will win the next World Cup? In the following year, will an individual or a company face criminal charges for an accident involving a self-driving vehicle? Participants don’t just answer yes or no; they have to give their odds. It’s a systematic way of testing whether they know what they don’t know. They get scored months later on accuracy and calibration—earning points not just for giving the right answer, but also for having the right level of conviction. The best forecasters have confidence in their predictions that come true and doubt in their predictions that prove false. On November 18, 2015, Jean-Pierre registered a prediction that stunned his opponents. A day earlier, a new question had popped up in an open forecasting tournament: in July 2016, who would win the U.S. Republican presidential primary? The options were Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, and none of the above. With eight months to go before the Republican National Convention, Trump was largely seen as a joke. His odds of becoming the Republican nominee were only 6 percent according to Nate Silver, the celebrated statistician behind the website FiveThirtyEight. When Jean-Pierre peered into his crystal ball, though, he decided Trump had a 68 percent chance of winning. Jean-Pierre didn’t just excel in predicting the results of American events. His Brexit forecasts hovered in the 50 percent range when most of his competitors thought the referendum had little chance of passing. He successfully predicted that the incumbent would lose a presidential election in Senegal, even though the base rates of reelection were extremely high and other forecasters were expecting a decisive win. And he had, in fact, pegged Trump as the favorite long before pundits and pollsters even considered him a viable contender. “It’s striking,” Jean-Pierre wrote early on, back in 2015, that so many forecasters are “still in denial about his chances.” Based on his performance, Jean-Pierre might be the world’s best election forecaster. His advantage: he thinks like a scientist. He’s passionately dispassionate. At various points in his life, Jean-Pierre has changed his political ideologies and religious beliefs.* He doesn’t come from a polling or statistics background; he’s a military historian, which means he has no stake in the way things have always been done in forecasting. The statisticians were attached to their views about how to aggregate polls. Jean-Pierre paid more attention to factors that were hard to measure and overlooked. For Trump, those included “Mastery at manipulating the medi","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:8:3","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"MISTAKES WERE MADE . . . MOST LIKELY BY ME As prescient as Jean-Pierre’s bet on Trump was, he still had trouble sticking to it in the face of his feelings. In the spring of 2016, he identified the media coverage of Hillary Clinton’s emails as a red flag, and kept predicting a Trump victory for two months more. By the summer, though, as he contemplated the impending possibility of a Trump presidency, he found himself struggling to sleep at night. He changed his forecast to Clinton. Looking back, Jean-Pierre isn’t defensive about his decision. He freely admits that despite being an experienced forecaster, he made the rookie mistake of falling victim to desirability bias, allowing his preference to cloud his judgment. He focused on the forces that would enable him to predict a Clinton win because he desperately wanted a Trump loss. “That was just a way of me trying to deal with this unpleasant forecast I had issued,” he says. Then he does something unexpected: he laughs at himself. If we’re insecure, we make fun of others. If we’re comfortable being wrong, we’re not afraid to poke fun at ourselves. Laughing at ourselves reminds us that although we might take our decisions seriously, we don’t have to take ourselves too seriously. Research suggests that the more frequently we make fun of ourselves, the happier we tend to be.* Instead of beating ourselves up about our mistakes, we can turn some of our past misconceptions into sources of present amusement. Being wrong won’t always be joyful. The path to embracing mistakes is full of painful moments, and we handle those moments better when we remember they’re essential for progress. But if we can’t learn to find occasional glee in discovering we were wrong, it will be awfully hard to get anything right. I’ve noticed a paradox in great scientists and superforecasters: the reason they’re so comfortable being wrong is that they’re terrified of being wrong. What sets them apart is the time horizon. They’re determined to reach the correct answer in the long run, and they know that means they have to be open to stumbling, backtracking, and rerouting in the short run. They shun rose-colored glasses in favor of a sturdy mirror. The fear of missing the mark next year is a powerful motivator to get a crystal-clear view of last year’s mistakes. “People who are right a lot listen a lot, and they change their mind a lot,” Jeff Bezos says. “If you don’t change your mind frequently, you’re going to be wrong a lot.” Jean-Pierre Beugoms has a favorite trick for catching himself when he’s wrong. When he makes a forecast, he also makes a list of the conditions in which it should hold true—as well as the conditions under which he would change his mind. He explains that this keeps him honest, preventing him from getting attached to a bad prediction. What forecasters do in tournaments is good practice in life. When you form an opinion, ask yourself what would have to happen to prove it false. Then keep track of your views so you can see when you were right, when you were wrong, and how your thinking has evolved. “I started out just wanting to prove myself,” Jean-Pierre says. “Now I want to improve myself—to see how good I can get.” It’s one thing to admit to ourselves that we’ve been wrong. It’s another thing to confess that to other people. Even if we manage to overthrow our inner dictator, we run the risk of facing outer ridicule. In some cases we fear that if others find out we were wrong, it could destroy our reputations. How do people who accept being wrong cope with that? In the early 1990s, the British physicist Andrew Lyne published a major discovery in the world’s most prestigious science journal. He presented the first evidence that a planet could orbit a neutron star—a star that had exploded into a supernova. Several months later, while preparing to give a presentation at an astronomy conference, he noticed that he hadn’t adjusted for the fact that the Earth moves in an elliptical orbit, not a c","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:8:4","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"CHAPTER 4 ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:9:0","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"The Good Fight Club ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:10:0","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"The Psychology of Constructive Conflict Arguments are extremely vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions. —oscar wilde As the two youngest boys in a big family, the bishop’s sons did everything together. They launched a newspaper and built their own printing press together. They opened a bicycle shop and then started manufacturing their own bikes together. And after years of toiling away at a seemingly impossible problem, they invented the first successful airplane together. Wilbur and Orville Wright first caught the flying bug when their father brought home a toy helicopter. After it broke, they built one of their own. As they advanced from playing together to working together to rethinking human flight together, there was no trace of sibling rivalry between them. Wilbur even said they “thought together.” Even though it was Wilbur who launched the project, the brothers shared equal credit for their achievement. When it came time to decide who would pilot their historic flight at Kitty Hawk, they just flipped a coin. New ways of thinking often spring from old bonds. The comedic chemistry of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler can be traced back to their early twenties, when they immediately hit it off in an improv class. The musical harmony of the Beatles started even earlier, when they were in high school. Just minutes after a mutual friend introduced them, Paul McCartney was teaching John Lennon how to tune a guitar. Ben \u0026 Jerry’s Ice Cream grew out of a friendship between the two founders that began in seventh-grade gym class. It seems that to make progress together, we need to be in sync. But the truth, like all truths, is more complicated. One of the world’s leading experts on conflict is an organizational psychologist in Australia named Karen “Etty” Jehn. When you think about conflict, you’re probably picturing what Etty calls relationship conflict—personal, emotional clashes that are filled not just with friction but also with animosity. I hate your stinking guts. I’ll use small words so that you’ll be sure to understand, you warthog-faced buffoon. You bob for apples in the toilet . . . and you like it. But Etty has identified another flavor called task conflict—clashes about ideas and opinions. We have task conflict when we’re debating whom to hire, which restaurant to pick for dinner, or whether to name our child Gertrude or Quasar. The question is whether the two types of conflict have different consequences. A few years ago I surveyed hundreds of new teams in Silicon Valley on conflict several times during their first six months working together. Even if they argued constantly and agreed on nothing else, they agreed on what kind of conflict they were having. When their projects were finished, I asked their managers to evaluate each team’s effectiveness. The teams that performed poorly started with more relationship conflict than task conflict. They entered into personal feuds early on and were so busy disliking one another that they didn’t feel comfortable challenging one another. It took months for many of the teams to make real headway on their relationship issues, and by the time they did manage to debate key decisions, it was often too late to rethink their directions. What happened in the high-performing groups? As you might expect, they started with low relationship conflict and kept it low throughout their work together. That didn’t stop them from having task conflict at the outset: they didn’t hesitate to surface competing perspectives. As they resolved some of their differences of opinion, they were able to align on a direction and carry out their work until they ran into new issues to debate. All in all, more than a hundred studies have examined conflict types in over eight thousand teams. A meta-analysis of those studies showed that relationship conflict is generally bad for performance, but some task conflict can be beneficial: it’s been linked to higher creativity and smarter choices.

Maybe it’s because my group of friends dropped me in middle school. Maybe it’s genetic. Maybe it’s because my parents got divorced. Whatever the cause, in psychology there’s a name for my affliction. It’s called agreeableness, and it’s one of the major personality traits around the world. Agreeable people tend to be nice. Friendly. Polite. Canadian.* My first impulse is to avoid even the most trivial of conflicts. When I’m riding in an Uber and the air-conditioning is blasting, I struggle to bring myself to ask the driver to turn it down—I just sit there shivering in silence until my teeth start to chatter. When someone steps on my shoe, I’ve actually apologized for inconveniently leaving my foot in his path. When students fill out course evaluations, one of their most common complaints is that I’m “too supportive of stupid comments.” Disagreeable people tend to be more critical, skeptical, and challenging—and they’re more likely than their peers to become engineers and lawyers. They’re not just comfortable with conflict; it energizes them. If you’re highly disagreeable, you might be happier in an argument than in a friendly conversation. That quality often comes with a bad rap: disagreeable people get stereotyped as curmudgeons who complain about every idea, or Dementors who suck the joy out of every meeting. When I studied Pixar, though, I came away with a dramatically different view. In 2000, Pixar was on fire. Their teams had used computers to rethink animation in their first blockbuster, Toy Story, and they were fresh off two more smash hits. Yet the company’s founders weren’t content to rest on their laurels. They recruited an outside director named Brad Bird to shake things up. Brad had just released his debut film, which was well reviewed but flopped at the box office, so he was itching to do something big and bold. When he pitched his vision, the technical leadership at Pixar said it was impossible: they would need a decade and $500 million to make it. Brad wasn’t ready to give up. He sought out the biggest misfits at Pixar for his project—people who were disagreeable, disgruntled, and dissatisfied. Some called them black sheep. Others called them pirates. When Brad rounded them up, he warned them that no one believed they could pull off the project. Just four years later, his team didn’t only succeed in releasing Pixar’s most complex film ever; they actually managed to lower the cost of production per minute. The Incredibles went on to gross upwards of $631 million worldwide and won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. Notice what Brad didn’t do. He didn’t stock his team with agreeable people. Agreeable people make for a great support network: they’re excited to encourage us and cheerlead for us. Rethinking depends on a different kind of network: a challenge network, a group of people we trust to point out our blind spots and help us overcome our weaknesses. Their role is to activate rethinking cycles by pushing us to be humble about our expertise, doubt our knowledge, and be curious about new perspectives. The ideal members of a challenge network are disagreeable, because they’re fearless about questioning the way things have always been done and holding us accountable for thinking again. There’s evidence that disagreeable people speak up more frequently—especially when leaders aren’t receptive—and foster more task conflict. They’re like the doctor in the show House or the boss in the film The Devil Wears Prada. They give the critical feedback we might not want to hear, but need to hear. Harnessing disagreeable people isn’t always easy. It helps if certain conditions are in place. Studies in oil drilling and tech companies suggest that dissatisfaction promotes creativity only when people feel committed and supported—and that cultural misfits are most likely to add value when they have strong bonds with their colleague","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:11:1","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"DON’T AGREE TO DISAGREE Hashing out competing views has potential downsides—risks that need to be managed. On the first Incredibles film, a rising star named Nicole Grindle had managed the simulation of the hair, watching John and Brad’s interactions from a distance. When Nicole came in to produce the sequel with John, one of her concerns was that the volume of the arguments between the two highly accomplished leaders might drown out the voices of people who were less comfortable speaking up: newcomers, introverts, women, and minorities. It’s common for people who lack power or status to shift into politician mode, suppressing their dissenting views in favor of conforming to the HIPPO—the HIghest Paid Person’s Opinion. Sometimes they have no other choice if they want to survive. To make sure their desire for approval didn’t prevent them from introducing task conflict, Nicole encouraged new people to bring their divergent ideas to the table. Some voiced them directly to the group; others went to her for feedback and support. Although Nicole wasn’t a pirate, as she found herself advocating for different perspectives she became more comfortable challenging Brad on characters and dialogue. “Brad is still the ornery guy who first came to Pixar, so you have to be ready for a spirited debate when you put forward a contrary point of view.” The notion of a spirited debate captures something important about how and why good fights happen. If you watch Brad argue with his colleagues—or the pirates fight with one another—you can quickly see that the tension is intellectual, not emotional. The tone is vigorous and feisty rather than combative or aggressive. They don’t disagree just for the sake of it; they disagree because they care. “Whether you disagree loudly, or quietly yet persistently put forward a different perspective,” Nicole explains, “we come together to support the common goal of excellence—of making great films.” After seeing their interactions up close, I finally understood what had long felt like a contradiction in my own personality: how I could be highly agreeable and still cherish a good argument. Agreeableness is about seeking social harmony, not cognitive consensus. It’s possible to disagree without being disagreeable. Although I’m terrified of hurting other people’s feelings, when it comes to challenging their thoughts, I have no fear. In fact, when I argue with someone, it’s not a display of disrespect—it’s a sign of respect. It means I value their views enough to contest them. If their opinions didn’t matter to me, I wouldn’t bother. I know I have chemistry with someone when we find it delightful to prove each other wrong. Agreeable people don’t always steer clear of conflict. They’re highly attuned to the people around them and often adapt to the norms in the room. My favorite demonstration is an experiment by my colleagues Jennifer Chatman and Sigal Barsade. Agreeable people were significantly more accommodating than disagreeable ones—as long as they were in a cooperative team. When they were assigned to a competitive team, they acted just as disagreeably as their disagreeable teammates. That’s how working with Brad Bird influenced John Walker. John’s natural tendency is to avoid conflict: at restaurants, if the waiter brings him the wrong dish, he just goes ahead and eats it anyway. “But when I’m involved in something bigger than myself,” he observes, “I feel like I have an opportunity, a responsibility really, to speak up, speak out, debate. Fight like hell when the morning whistle blows, but go out for a beer after the one at five o’clock.” That adaptability was also visible in the Wright brothers’ relationship. In Wilbur, Orville had a built-in challenge network. Wilbur was known to be highly disagreeable: he was unfazed by other people’s opinions and had a habit of pouncing on anyone else’s idea the moment it was raised. Orville was known as gentle, cheerful, and sensitive to criticism. Yet those qualities see","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:11:2","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"GETTING HOT WITHOUT GETTING MAD A major problem with task conflict is that it often spills over into relationship conflict. One minute you’re disagreeing about how much seasoning to put on the Thanksgiving turkey, and the next minute you find yourself yelling “You smell!” Although the Wright brothers had a lifetime of experience discovering each other’s hot buttons, that didn’t mean they always kept their cool. Their last grand challenge before liftoff was their single hardest problem: designing a propeller. They knew their airplane couldn’t take flight without one, but the right kind didn’t exist. As they struggled with various approaches, they argued back and forth for hours at a time, often raising their voices. The feuding lasted for months as each took turns preaching the merits of his own solutions and prosecuting the other’s points. Eventually their younger sister, Katharine, threatened to leave the house if they didn’t stop fighting. They kept at it anyway, until one night it culminated in what might have been the loudest shouting match of their lives. Strangely, the next morning, they came into the shop and acted as if nothing had happened. They picked up the argument about the propeller right where they had left off—only now without the yelling. Soon they were both rethinking their assumptions and stumbling onto what would become one of their biggest breakthroughs. The Wright brothers were masters at having intense task conflict without relationship conflict. When they raised their voices, it reflected intensity rather than hostility. As their mechanic marveled, “I don’t think they really got mad, but they sure got awfully hot.” Experiments show that simply framing a dispute as a debate rather than as a disagreement signals that you’re receptive to considering dissenting opinions and changing your mind, which in turn motivates the other person to share more information with you. A disagreement feels personal and potentially hostile; we expect a debate to be about ideas, not emotions. Starting a disagreement by asking, “Can we debate?” sends a message that you want to think like a scientist, not a preacher or a prosecutor—and encourages the other person to think that way, too. The Wright brothers had the benefit of growing up in a family where disagreements were seen as productive and enjoyable. When arguing with others, though, they often had to go out of their way to reframe their behavior. “Honest argument is merely a process of mutually picking the beams and motes out of each other’s eyes so both can see clearly,” Wilbur once wrote to a colleague whose ego was bruised after a fiery exchange about aeronautics. Wilbur stressed that it wasn’t personal: he saw arguments as opportunities to test and refine their thinking. “I see that you are back at your old trick of giving up before you are half beaten in an argument. I feel pretty certain of my own ground but was anticipating the pleasure of a good scrap before the matter was settled. Discussion brings out new ways of looking at things.” When they argued about the propeller, the Wright brothers were making a common mistake. Each was preaching about why he was right and why the other was wrong. When we argue about why, we run the risk of becoming emotionally attached to our positions and dismissive of the other side’s. We’re more likely to have a good fight if we argue about how. When social scientists asked people why they favor particular policies on taxes, health care, or nuclear sanctions, they often doubled down on their convictions. Asking people to explain how those policies would work in practice—or how they’d explain them to an expert—activated a rethinking cycle. They noticed gaps in their knowledge, doubted their conclusions, and became less extreme; they were now more curious about alternative options. Psychologists find that many of us are vulnerable to an illusion of explanatory depth.

He’s been told it’s a world record. But his opponent today presents a unique challenge. Debra Jo Prectet is a prodigy hailing from Haifa, Israel. She’s just eight years old, and although she made her first foray into public debating only last summer, she’s been preparing for this moment for years. Debra has absorbed countless articles to accumulate knowledge, closely studied speechwriting to hone her clarity, and even practiced her delivery to incorporate humor. Now she’s ready to challenge the champion himself. Her parents are hoping she’ll make history. Harish was a wunderkind too. By the time he was eight, he was outmaneuvering his own parents in dinner-table debates about the Indian caste system. He went on to become the European debate champion and a grand finalist in the world debate championship, and coached the Filipino national school debate team at the world championship. I was introduced to Harish by an unusually bright former student who used to compete against him, and remembers having lost “many (likely all)” of their debates. Harish and Debra are facing off in San Francisco in February 2019 in front of a large crowd. They’ve been kept in the dark about the debate topic. When they walk onstage, the moderator announces the subject: should preschools be subsidized by the government? After just fifteen minutes of preparation, Debra will present her strongest arguments in favor of subsidies, and Harish will marshal his best case against them. Their goal is to win the audience over to their side on preschool subsidies, but their impact on me will be much broader: they’ll end up changing my view of what it takes to win a debate. Debra kicks off with a joke, drawing laughter from the crowd by telling Harish that although he may hold the world record in debate wins, he’s never debated someone like her. Then she goes on to summarize an impressive number of studies—citing her sources—about the academic, social, and professional benefits of preschool programs. For good measure, she quotes a former prime minister’s argument about preschool being a smart investment. Harish acknowledges the facts that Debra presented, but then makes his case that subsidizing preschools is not the appropriate remedy for the damage caused by poverty. He suggests that the issue should be evaluated on two grounds: whether preschool is currently underprovided and underconsumed, and whether it helps those who are the least fortunate. He argues that in a world full of trade-offs, subsidizing preschool is not the best use of taxpayer money. Going into the debate, 92 percent of the audience has already made up their minds. I’m one of them: it didn’t take me long to figure out where I stood on preschool subsidies. In the United States, public education is free from kindergarten through high school. I’m familiar with evidence that early access to education in the first few years of children’s lives may be even more critical to helping them escape poverty than anything they learn later. I believe education is a fundamental human right, like access to water, food, shelter, and health care. That puts me on Team Debra. As I watch the debate, her early arguments strike a chord. Here are some highlights: Debra: Research clearly shows that a good preschool can help kids overcome the disadvantages often associated with poverty. Data for the win! Be still, my beating heart. Debra: You will possibly hear my opponent talk today about different priorities . . . he might say that subsidies are needed, but not for preschools. I would like to ask you, Mr. Natarajan . . . why don’t we examine the evidence and the data and decide accordingly?

Since she was already well on her way to building a successful career, I told her it was a waste of time and money. I walked her through the lack of evidence that a graduate degree would make a tangible difference in her future, and the risk that she’d end up overqualified and underexperienced. When she insisted that her employer expected an MBA for promotions, I told her that I knew of exceptions and pointed out that she probably wouldn’t spend her whole career at that firm anyway. Finally, she hit back: “You’re a logic bully!” A what? “A logic bully,” Jamie repeated. “You just overwhelmed me with rational arguments, and I don’t agree with them, but I can’t fight back.” At first I was delighted by the label. It felt like a solid description of one of my roles as a social scientist: to win debates with the best data. Then Jamie explained that my approach wasn’t actually helpful. The more forcefully I argued, the more she dug in her heels. Suddenly I realized I had instigated that same kind of resistance many times before. David Sipress/The New Yorker Collection/The Cartoon Bank; © Condé Nast Growing up, I was taught by my karate sensei never to start a fight unless I was prepared to be the only one standing at the end. That’s how I approached debates at work and with friends: I thought the key to victory was to go into battle armed with airtight logic and rigorous data. The harder I attacked, though, the harder my opponents fought back. I was laser-focused on convincing them to accept my views and rethink theirs, but I was coming across like a preacher and a prosecutor. Although those mindsets sometimes motivated me to persist in making my points, I often ended up alienating my audience. I was not winning. For centuries, debating has been prized as an art form, but there’s now a growing science of how to do it well. In a formal debate your goal is to change the mind of your audience. In an informal debate, you’re trying to change the mind of your conversation partner. That’s a kind of negotiation, where you’re trying to reach an agreement about the truth. To build my knowledge and skills about how to win debates, I studied the psychology of negotiations and eventually used what I’d learned to teach bargaining skills to leaders across business and government. I came away convinced that my instincts—and what I’d learned in karate—were dead wrong. A good debate is not a war. It’s not even a tug-of-war, where you can drag your opponent to your side if you pull hard enough on the rope. It’s more like a dance that hasn’t been choreographed, negotiated with a partner who has a different set of steps in mind. If you try too hard to lead, your partner will resist. If you can adapt your moves to hers, and get her to do the same, you’re more likely to end up in rhythm. In a classic study, a team of researchers led by Neil Rackham examined what expert negotiators do differently. They recruited one group of average negotiators and another group of highly skilled ones, who had significant track records of success and had been rated as effective by their counterparts. To compare the participants’ techniques, they recorded both groups doing labor and contract negotiations. In a war, our goal is to gain ground rather than lose it, so we’re often afraid to surrender a few battles. In a negotiation, agreeing with someone else’s argument is disarming. The experts recognized that in their dance they couldn’t stand still and expect the other person to make all the moves. To get in harmony, they needed to step back from time to time. One difference was visible before anyone even arrived at the bargaining table. Prior to the negotiations, the researchers interviewed both groups about their plans. The average negotiators went in armed for battle, hardly taking note of any anticipated areas of agreement. The experts, in contrast,","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:14:1","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"DANCING TO THE SAME BEAT Since the audience started out favoring preschool subsidies, there was more room for change in Harish’s direction—but he also had the more difficult task of advocating for the unpopular position. He opened the audience’s mind by taking a page out of the playbook of expert negotiators. Harish started by emphasizing common ground. When he took the stage for his rebuttal, he immediately drew attention to his and Debra’s areas of agreement. “So,” he began, “I think we disagree on far less than it may seem.” He called out their alignment on the problem of poverty—and on the validity of some of the studies—before objecting to subsidies as a solution. We won’t have much luck changing other people’s minds if we refuse to change ours. We can demonstrate openness by acknowledging where we agree with our critics and even what we’ve learned from them. Then, when we ask what views they might be willing to revise, we’re not hypocrites. Convincing other people to think again isn’t just about making a good argument—it’s about establishing that we have the right motives in doing so. When we concede that someone else has made a good point, we signal that we’re not preachers, prosecutors, or politicians trying to advance an agenda. We’re scientists trying to get to the truth. “Arguments are often far more combative and adversarial than they need to be,” Harish told me. “You should be willing to listen to what someone else is saying and give them a lot of credit for it. It makes you sound like a reasonable person who is taking everything into account.” Being reasonable literally means that we can be reasoned with, that we’re open to evolving our views in light of logic and data. So in the debate with Harish, why did Debra neglect to do that—why did she overlook common ground? It’s not because Debra is eight years old. It’s because she isn’t human. Debra Jo Prectet is an anagram I invented. Her official name is Project Debater, and she’s a machine. More specifically, an artificial intelligence developed by IBM to do for debate what Watson did for chess. They first dreamed the idea up in 2011 and started working intensively on it in 2014. Just a few years later, Project Debater had developed the remarkable ability to conduct an intelligent debate in public, complete with facts, coherent sentences, and even counterarguments. Her knowledge corpus consists of 400 million articles, largely from credible newspapers and magazines, and her claim detection engine is designed to locate key arguments, identify their boundaries, and weigh the evidence. For any debate topic, she can instantaneously search her knowledge graph for relevant data points, mold them into a logical case, and deliver it clearly—even entertainingly—in a female voice within the time constraints. Her first words in the preschool subsidy debate were, “Greetings, Harish. I’ve heard you hold the world record in debate competition wins against humans, but I suspect you’ve never debated a machine. Welcome to the future.” Of course, it’s possible that Harish won because the audience was biased against the computer and rooting for the human. It’s worth noting, though, that Harish’s approach in that debate is the same one that he’s used to defeat countless humans on international stages. What amazes me is that the computer was able to master multiple complex capabilities while completely missing this crucial one. After studying 10 billion sentences, a computer was able to say something funny—a skill that’s normally thought to be confined to sentient beings with high levels of social and emotional intelligence. The computer had learned to make a logical argument and even anticipate the other side’s counterargument. Yet it hadn’t learned to agree with elements of the other side’s argument, apparently because that behavior was all too rarely deployed across 400 million articles by humans. They were usually too busy preaching their arguments, prosecuting their enemies, or po","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:14:2","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"DON’T STEP ON THEIR TOES Harish’s next advantage stemmed from one of his disadvantages. He would never have access to as many facts as the computer. When the audience was polled afterward about who taught them more, the overwhelming majority said they learned more from the computer than from Harish. But it was Harish who succeeded in swaying their opinions. Why? The computer piled on study after study to support a long list of reasons in favor of preschool subsidies. Like a skilled negotiator, Harish focused on just two reasons against them. He knew that making too many points could come at the cost of developing, elaborating, and reinforcing his best ones. “If you have too many arguments, you’ll dilute the power of each and every one,” he told me. “They are going to be less well explained, and I don’t know if any of them will land enough—I don’t think the audience will believe them to be important enough. Most top debaters aren’t citing a lot of information.” Is this always the best way to approach a debate? The answer is—like pretty much everything else in social science—it depends. The ideal number of reasons varies from one circumstance to another. There are times when preaching and prosecuting can make us more persuasive. Research suggests that the effectiveness of these approaches hinges on three key factors: how much people care about the issue, how open they are to our particular argument, and how strong-willed they are in general. If they’re not invested in the issue or they’re receptive to our perspective, more reasons can help: people tend to see quantity as a sign of quality. The more the topic matters to them, the more the quality of reasons matters. It’s when audiences are skeptical of our view, have a stake in the issue, and tend to be stubborn that piling on justifications is most likely to backfire. If they’re resistant to rethinking, more reasons simply give them more ammunition to shoot our views down. It’s not just about the number of reasons, though. It’s also how they fit together. A university once approached me to see if I could bring in donations from alumni who had never given a dime. My colleagues and I ran an experiment testing two different messages meant to convince thousands of resistant alumni to give. One message emphasized the opportunity to do good: donating would benefit students, faculty, and staff. The other emphasized the opportunity to feel good: donors would enjoy the warm glow of giving. The two messages were equally effective: in both cases, 6.5 percent of the stingy alumni ended up donating. Then we combined them, because two reasons are better than one. Except they weren’t. When we put the two reasons together, the giving rate dropped below 3 percent. Each reason alone was more than twice as effective as the two combined. The audience was already skeptical. When we gave them different kinds of reasons to donate, we triggered their awareness that someone was trying to persuade them—and they shielded themselves against it. A single line of argument feels like a conversation; multiple lines of argument can become an onslaught. The audience tuned out the preacher and summoned their best defense attorney to refute the prosecutor. As important as the quantity and quality of reasons might be, the source matters, too. And the most convincing source is often the one closest to your audience. A student in one of my classes, Rachel Breuhaus, noticed that although top college basketball teams have rabid fans, there are usually empty seats in their arenas. To study strategies for motivating more fans to show up, we launched an experiment in the week before an upcoming game targeting hundreds of season ticket holders. When left to their own devices, 77 percent of these supposedly die-hard fans actually made it to the game. We decided that the most persuasive message would come from the team itself, so we sent fans an email with quotes from players and coaches about how part of the home-court adva","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:14:3","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HOSTILE Some years ago, a Wall Street firm brought me in to consult on a project to attract and retain junior analysts and associates. After two months of research I submitted a report with twenty-six data-driven recommendations. In the middle of my presentation to the leadership team, one of the members interrupted and asked, “Why don’t we just pay them more?” I told him money alone probably wouldn’t make a difference. Many studies across a range of industries have shown that once people are earning enough to meet their basic needs, paying them more doesn’t stop them from leaving bad jobs and bad bosses. The executive started arguing with me: “That’s not what I’ve found in my experience.” I fired back in prosecutor mode: “Yes, that’s why I brought you randomized, controlled experiments with longitudinal data: to learn rigorously from many people’s experiences, not idiosyncratically from yours.” The executive pushed back, insisting that his company was different, so I rattled off some basic statistics from his own employees. In surveys and interviews, a grand total of zero had even mentioned compensation. They were already well paid (read: overpaid), and if that could have solved the problem, it already would have.* But the executive still refused to budge. Finally I became so exasperated that I did something out of character. I shot back, “I’ve never seen a group of smart people act so dumb.” In the hierarchy of disagreement created by computer scientist Paul Graham, the highest form of argument is refuting the central point, and the lowest is name-calling. In a matter of seconds I’d devolved from logic bully to playground bully. If I could do that session over, I’d start with common ground and fewer data points. Instead of attacking their beliefs with my research, I’d ask them what would open their minds to my data. A few years later, I had a chance to test that approach. During a keynote speech on creativity, I cited evidence that Beethoven and Mozart didn’t have higher hit rates than some of their peers; they generated a larger volume of work, which gave them more shots at greatness. A member of the audience interrupted. “Bullsh*t!” he shouted. “You’re disrespecting the great masters of music. You’re totally ignorant—you don’t know what you’re talking about!” Instead of reacting right then, I waited a few minutes until a scheduled break and then made my way to my heckler. Me: You’re welcome to disagree with the data, but I don’t think that’s a respectful way to express your opinion. It’s not how I was trained to have an intellectual debate. Were you? Music man: Well, no . . . I just think you’re wrong. Me: It’s not my opinion—it’s the independent finding of two different social scientists. What evidence would change your mind? Music man: I don’t believe you can quantify a musician’s greatness, but I’d like to see the research. When I sent him the study, he responded with an apology. I don’t know if I succeeded in changing his mind, but I had done a better job of opening it. When someone becomes hostile, if you respond by viewing the argument as a war, you can either attack or retreat. If instead you treat it as a dance, you have another option—you can sidestep. Having a conversation about the conversation shifts attention away from the substance of the disagreement and toward the process for having a dialogue. The more anger and hostility the other person expresses, the more curiosity and interest you show. When someone is losing control, your tranquility is a sign of strength. It takes the wind out of their emotional sails. It’s pretty rare for someone to respond by screaming “SCREAMING IS MY PREFERRED MODE OF COMMUNICATION!” This is a fifth move that expert negotiators made more often than average negotiators. They were more likely to comment on their feelings about the process and test their understanding of the other side’s feelings: I’m disappointed in the way this discussion has unfolded—are you fr","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:14:4","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"THE STRENGTH OF WEAK OPINIONS When we hit a brick wall in a debate, we don’t have to stop talking altogether. “Let’s agree to disagree” shouldn’t end a discussion. It should start a new conversation, with a focus on understanding and learning rather than arguing and persuading. That’s what we’d do in scientist mode: take the long view and ask how we could have handled the debate more effectively. Doing so might land us in a better position to make the same case to a different person—or to make a different case to the same person on a different day. When I asked one of the Wall Street executives for advice on how to approach debates differently in the future, he suggested expressing less conviction. I could easily have countered that I was uncertain about which of my twenty-six recommendations might be relevant. I could also have conceded that although money didn’t usually solve the problem, I’d never seen anyone test the effect of million-dollar retention bonuses. That would be a fun experiment to run, don’t you think? A few years ago, I argued in my book Originals that if we want to fight groupthink, it helps to have “strong opinions, weakly held.” Since then I’ve changed my mind—I now believe that’s a mistake. If we hold an opinion weakly, expressing it strongly can backfire. Communicating it with some uncertainty signals confident humility, invites curiosity, and leads to a more nuanced discussion. Research shows that in courtrooms, expert witnesses and deliberating jurors are more credible and more persuasive when they express moderate confidence, rather than high or low confidence.* And these principles aren’t limited to debates—they apply in a wide range of situations where we’re advocating for our beliefs or even for ourselves. In 2014, a young woman named Michele Hansen came across a job opening for a product manager at an investment company. She was excited about the position but she wasn’t qualified for it: she had no background in finance and lacked the required number of years of experience. If you were in her shoes and you decided to go for it, what would you say in your cover letter? The natural starting point would be to emphasize your strengths and downplay your weaknesses. As Michael Scott deadpanned on The Office, “I work too hard, I care too much, and sometimes I can be too invested in my job.” But Michele Hansen did the opposite, taking a page out of the George Costanza playbook on Seinfeld: “My name is George. I’m unemployed and I live with my parents.” Rather than trying to hide her shortcomings, Michele opened with them. “I’m probably not the candidate you’ve been envisioning,” her cover letter began. “I don’t have a decade of experience as a Product Manager nor am I a Certified Financial Planner.” After establishing the drawbacks of her case, she emphasized a few reasons to hire her anyway: But what I do have are skills that can’t be taught. I take ownership of projects far beyond my pay grade and what is in my defined scope of responsibilities. I don’t wait for people to tell me what to do and go seek for myself what needs to be done. I invest myself deeply in my projects and it shows in everything I do, from my projects at work to my projects that I undertake on my own time at night. I’m entrepreneurial, I get things done, and I know I would make an excellent right hand for the co-founder leading this project. I love breaking new ground and starting with a blank slate. (And any of my previous bosses would be able to attest to these traits.) A week later a recruiter contacted her for a phone screen, and then she had another phone screen with the team. On the calls, she asked about experiments they’d run recently that had surprised them. The question itself surprised the team—they ended up talking about times when they were sure they were right but were later proven wrong.

It wasn’t his first time being the only Black man in the room. Before the night was out, it would be his first time having a conversation with a white supremacist. After the show, an older white man in the audience walked up to Daryl and told him that he was astonished to see a Black musician play like Jerry Lee Lewis. Daryl replied that he and Lewis were, in fact, friends, and that Lewis himself had acknowledged that his style was influenced by Black musicians. Although the man was skeptical, he invited Daryl to sit down for a drink. Soon the man was admitting that he’d never had a drink with a Black person before. Eventually he explained to Daryl why. He was a member of the Ku Klux Klan, the white supremacist hate group that had been murdering African Americans for over a century and had lynched a man just two years earlier. If you found yourself sitting down with someone who hated you and all people who shared your skin color, your instinctive options might be fight, flight, or freeze—and rightfully so. Daryl had a different reaction: he burst out laughing. When the man pulled out his KKK membership card to show he wasn’t joking, Daryl returned to a question that had been on his mind since he was ten years old. In the late 1960s, he was marching in a Cub Scout parade when white spectators started throwing cans, rocks, and bottles at him. It was the first time he remembers facing overt racism, and although he could justifiably have gotten angry, he was bewildered: “How can you hate me when you don’t even know me?” At the end of the conversation, the Klansman handed Daryl his phone number and asked if he would call him whenever he was playing locally. Daryl followed up, and the next month the man showed up with a bunch of his friends to see Daryl perform. Over time a friendship grew, and the man ended up leaving the KKK. That was a turning point in Daryl’s life, too. It wasn’t long before Daryl was sitting down with Imperial Wizards and Grand Dragons—the Klan’s highest officers—to ask his question. Since then, Daryl has convinced many white supremacists to leave the KKK and abandon their hatred. I wanted to understand how that kind of change happens—how to break overconfidence cycles that are steeped in stereotypes and prejudice about entire groups of people. Strangely enough, my journey started at a baseball game.

Yankees suck!” It was a summer night at Fenway Park, my first and only time at a Boston Red Sox baseball game. In the seventh inning, without warning, 37,000 people erupted into a chant. The entire stadium was dissing the New York Yankees in perfect harmony. I knew the two teams had a century-long rivalry, widely viewed as the most heated in all of American professional sports. I took it for granted that the Boston fans would root against the Yankees. I just didn’t expect it to happen that day, because the Yankees weren’t even there. The Red Sox were playing against the Oakland A’s. The Boston fans were booing a team that was hundreds of miles away. It was as if Burger King fans were going head-to-head against Wendy’s in a taste test and started chanting “McDonald’s sucks!” I started to wonder if Red Sox fans hate the Yankees more than they love their own team. Boston parents have been known to teach their kids to flip the bird at the Yankees and detest anything in pinstripes, and yankees suck is apparently among the most popular T-shirts in Boston history. When asked how much money it would take to get them to taunt their own team, Red Sox fans requested an average of $503. To root for the Yankees, they wanted even more: $560. The feelings run so deep that neuroscientists can watch them light up people’s minds: when Red Sox fans see the Yankees fail, they show immediate activation in brain regions linked to reward and pleasure. Those feelings extend well beyond Boston: in a 2019 analysis of tweets, the Yankees were the most hated baseball team in twenty-eight of the fifty U.S. states, which may explain the popularity of this T-shirt: I recently called a friend who’s a die-hard Red Sox fan with a simple question: what would it take to get him to root for the Yankees? Without pausing, he said, “If they were playing Al Qaeda . . . maybe.” It’s one thing to love your team. It’s another to hate your rivals so much that you’d consider rooting for terrorists to crush them. If you despise a particular sports team—and its fans—you’re harboring some strong opinions about a group of people. Those beliefs are stereotypes, and they often spill over into prejudice. The stronger your attitudes become, the less likely you are to rethink them. Rivalries aren’t unique to sports. A rivalry exists whenever we reserve special animosity for a group we see as competing with us for resources or threatening our identities. In business, the rivalry between footwear companies Puma and Adidas was so intense that for generations, families self-segregated based on their allegiance to the brands—they went to different bakeries, pubs, and shops, and even refused to date people who worked for the rival firm. In politics, you probably know some Democrats who view Republicans as being greedy, ignorant, heartless cretins, and some Republicans who regard Democrats as lazy, dishonest, hypersensitive snowflakes. As stereotypes stick and prejudice deepens, we don’t just identify with our own group; we disidentify with our adversaries, coming to define who we are by what we’re not. We don’t just preach the virtues of our side; we find self-worth in prosecuting the vices of our rivals. When people hold prejudice toward a rival group, they’re often willing to do whatever it takes to elevate their own group and undermine their rivals—even if it means doing harm or doing wrong. We see people cross those lines regularly in sports rivalries.* Aggression extends well beyond the playing field: from Barcelona to Brazil, fistfights frequently break out between soccer fans. Cheating scandals are rampant, too, and they aren’t limited to athletes or coaches. When students at The Ohio State University were paid to participate in an experiment, they learned that if they were willing to lie to a student from a different school, their own pay would double and the other student’s compensation would be cut in half.

Take a seemingly innocuous question: is a hot dog a sandwich? When students answered this question, most felt strongly enough that they were willing to sacrifice a dollar to those who agreed with them to make sure those who disagreed got less. In every human society, people are motivated to seek belonging and status. Identifying with a group checks both boxes at the same time: we become part of a tribe, and we take pride when our tribe wins. In classic studies on college campuses, psychologists found that after their team won a football game, students were more likely to walk around wearing school swag. From Arizona State to Notre Dame to USC, students basked in the reflected glory of Saturday victories, donning team shirts and hats and jackets on Sunday. If their team lost, they shunned school apparel, and distanced themselves by saying “they lost” instead of “we lost.” Some economists and finance experts have even found that the stock market rises if a country’s soccer team wins World Cup matches and falls if they lose.* Rivalries are most likely to develop between teams that are geographically close, compete regularly, and are evenly matched. The Yankees and Red Sox fit this pattern: they’re both on the East Coast, they play each other eighteen or nineteen times a season, they both have histories of success, and as of 2019, they had competed over 2,200 times—with each team winning over 1,000 times. The two teams also have more fans than any other franchises in baseball. I decided to test what it would take to get fans to rethink their beliefs about their bitter rivals. Working with a doctoral student, Tim Kundro, I ran a series of experiments with passionate Yankees and Red Sox supporters. To get a sense of their stereotypes, we asked over a thousand Red Sox and Yankees fans to list three negative things about their rivals. They mostly used the same words to describe one another, complaining about their respective accents, their beards, and their tendency to “smell like old corn chips.” WHY RED SOX FANS HATE YANKEES FANS WHY YANKEES FANS HATE RED SOX FANS Once we’ve formed those kinds of stereotypes, for both mental and social reasons it’s hard to undo them. Psychologist George Kelly observed that our beliefs are like pairs of reality goggles. We use them to make sense of the world and navigate our surroundings. A threat to our opinions cracks our goggles, leaving our vision blurred. It’s only natural to put up our guard in response—and Kelly noticed that we become especially hostile when trying to defend opinions that we know, deep down, are false. Rather than trying on a different pair of goggles, we become mental contortionists, twisting and turning until we find an angle of vision that keeps our current views intact. Socially, there’s another reason stereotypes are so sticky. We tend to interact with people who share them, which makes them even more extreme. This phenomenon is called group polarization, and it’s been demonstrated in hundreds of experiments. Juries with authoritarian beliefs recommend harsher punishments after deliberating together. Corporate boards are more likely to support paying outlandish premiums for companies after group discussions. Citizens who start out with a clear belief on affirmative action and gay marriage develop more extreme views on these issues after talking with a few others who share their stance. Their preaching and prosecuting move in the direction of their politics. Polarization is reinforced by conformity: peripheral members fit in and gain status by following the lead of the most prototypical member of the group, who often holds the most intense views. Grow up in a family of Red Sox fans and you’re bound to hear some unpleasant things about Yankees fans.

A team of psychologists has studied the effects of outer space on inner space, assessing the changes in more than a hundred astronauts and cosmonauts through interviews, surveys, and analyses of autobiographies. Upon returning from space, astronauts are less focused on individual achievements and personal happiness, and more concerned about the collective good. “You develop an instant global consciousness . . . an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it,” Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell reflected. “From out there on the moon, international politics looks so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, ‘Look at that, you son of a b*tch.’” This reaction is known as the overview effect. The astronaut who described it most vividly to me is space shuttle commander Jeff Ashby. He recalled that the first time he looked back at the Earth from outer space, it changed him forever: On Earth, astronauts look to the stars—most of us are star fanatics—but in space, the stars look the same as they do on Earth. What is so different is the planet—the perspective that it gives you. My first glimpse of the Earth from space was about fifteen minutes into my first flight, when I looked up from my checklist and suddenly we were over the lit part of the Earth with our windows facing down. Below me was the continent of Africa, and it was moving by much as a city would move by from an airline seat. Circling the entire planet in ninety minutes, you see that thin blue arc of the atmosphere. Seeing how fragile the little layer is in which all of humankind exists, you can easily from space see the connection between someone on one side of the planet to someone on the other—and there are no borders evident. So it appears as just this one common layer that we all exist in. When you get to see an overview of the Earth from outer space, you realize you share a common identity with all human beings. I wanted to create a version of the overview effect for baseball fans. There’s some evidence that common identity can build bridges between rivals. In one experiment, psychologists randomly assigned Manchester United soccer fans a short writing task. They then staged an emergency in which a passing runner slipped and fell, screaming in pain as he held his ankle. He was wearing the T-shirt of their biggest rival, and the question was whether they would stop to help him. If the soccer fans had just written about why they loved their team, only 30 percent helped. If they had written about what they had in common with other soccer fans, 70 percent helped. When Tim and I tried to get Red Sox and Yankees fans to reflect on their common identity as baseball fans, it didn’t work. They didn’t end up with more positive views of one another or a greater willingness to help one another outside emergency situations. Shared identity doesn’t stick in every circumstance. If a rival fan has just had an accident, thinking about a common identity might motivate us to help. If he’s not in danger or dire need, though, it’s too easy to dismiss him as just another jerk—or not our responsibility. “We both love baseball,” one Red Sox supporter commented. “The Yankees fans just like the wrong team.” Another stated that their shared love of baseball had no effect on his opinions: “The Yankees suck, and their fans are annoying.” ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:17:3","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"HYPOTHESIS 2: FEELING FOR OUR FOES I next turned to the psychology of peace. Years ago the pioneering psychologist and Holocaust survivor Herb Kelman set out to challenge some of the stereotypes behind the Israel-Palestine conflict by teaching the two sides to understand and empathize with one another. He designed interactive problem-solving workshops in which influential Israeli and Palestinian leaders talked off the record about paths to peace. For years, they came together to share their own experiences and perspectives, address one another’s needs and fears, and explore novel solutions to the conflict. Over time, the workshops didn’t just shatter stereotypes—some of the participants ended up forming lifelong friendships. Humanizing the other side should be much easier in sports, because the stakes are lower and the playing field is more level. I started with another of the biggest rivalries in sports: UNC-Duke. I asked Shane Battier, who led Duke to an NCAA basketball championship in 2001, what it would take for him to root for UNC. His immediate reply: “If they were playing the Taliban.” I had no idea so many people fantasized about crushing terrorists in their favorite sport. I wondered whether humanizing a Duke student would change UNC students’ stereotypes of the group. In an experiment with my colleagues Alison Fragale and Karren Knowlton, we asked UNC students to help improve the job application of a peer. If we mentioned that he went to Duke rather than UNC, as long as he was facing significant financial need, participants spent extra time helping him. Once they felt empathy for his plight, they saw him as a unique individual deserving of assistance and liked him more. Yet when we measured their views of Duke students in general, the UNC students were just as likely to see them as their rivals, to say that it felt like a personal compliment if they heard someone criticize Duke, and to take it as a personal insult if they heard Duke praised. We had succeeded in changing their attitudes toward the student, but failed in changing their stereotypes of the group. Something similar happened when Tim and I tried to humanize a Yankees fan. We had Red Sox fans read a story written by a baseball buff who had learned the game as a child with his grandfather and had fond memories of playing catch with his mom. At the very end of the piece he mentioned that he was a die-hard supporter of the Yankees. “I think this person is very authentic and is a rare Yankee fan,” one Red Sox supporter commented. “This person gets it and is not your typical Yankee fan,” a second observed. “Ugh, I really liked this text until I got to the part about them being a Yankees fan,” a third fan lamented, but “I think this particular person I would have more in common with than the typical, stereotypical Yankees fan. This person is okay.” Herb Kelman ran into the same problem with Israelis and Palestinians. In the problem-solving workshops, they came to trust the individuals across the table, but they still held on to their stereotypes of the group. In an ideal world, learning about individual group members will humanize the group, but often getting to know a person better just establishes her as different from the rest of her group. When we meet group members who defy a stereotype, our first instinct isn’t to see them as exemplars and rethink the stereotype. It’s to see them as exceptions and cling to our existing beliefs. So that attempt also failed. Back to the drawing board again.

As the camera zooms out, you see that he’s wearing an Ohio State Buckeyes sweatshirt and she’s wearing a Michigan Wolverines T-shirt. The caption: “Without sports, this wouldn’t be disgusting.” As a lifelong Wolverine fan, I was raised to boo at Buckeye fans. My uncle filled his basement with Michigan paraphernalia, got up at 3:00 a.m. on Saturdays to start setting up for tailgates, and drove a van with the Michigan logo emblazoned on the side. When I went back home to Michigan for grad school and one of my college roommates started medical school at Ohio State, it was only natural for me to preach my school’s superiority by phone and prosecute his intelligence by text. A few years ago, I got to know an unusually kind woman in her seventies who works with Holocaust survivors. Last summer, when she mentioned that she had gone to Ohio State, my first response was “yuck.” My next reaction was to be disgusted with myself. Who cares where she went to school half a century ago? How did I get programmed this way? Suddenly it seemed odd that anyone would hate a team at all. In ancient Greece, Plutarch wrote of a wooden ship that Theseus sailed from Crete to Athens. To preserve the ship, as its old planks decayed, Athenians would replace them with new wood. Eventually all the planks had been replaced. It looked like the same ship, but none of its parts was the same. Was it still the same ship? Later, philosophers added a wrinkle: if you collected all the original planks and fashioned them into a ship, would that be the same ship? The ship of Theseus has a lot in common with a sports franchise. If you hail from Boston, you might hate the 1920 Yankees for taking Babe Ruth or the 1978 Yankees for dashing your World Series hopes. Although the current team carries the same name, the pieces are different. The players are long gone. So are the managers and coaches. The stadium has been replaced. “You’re actually rooting for the clothes,” Jerry Seinfeld quipped. “Fans will be so in love with a player, but if he goes to a different team, they boo him. This is the same human being in a different shirt; they hate him now. Boo! Different shirt! Boo!” I think it’s a ritual. A fun but arbitrary ritual—a ceremony that we perform out of habit. We imprinted on it when we were young and impressionable, or were new to a city and looking for esprit de corps. Sure, there are moments where team loyalty does matter in our lives: it allows us to high-five acquaintances at bars and hug strangers at victory parades. It gives us a sense of solidarity. If you reflect on it, though, hating an opposing team is an accident of birth. If you had been born in New York instead of Boston, would you really hate the Yankees? For our third approach, Tim and I recruited fans of the Red Sox and Yankees. To prove their allegiance, they had to correctly name one of their team’s players from a photo—and the last year his team had won the World Series. Then we took some steps to open their minds. First, to help them recognize the complexity of their own beliefs, we asked them to list three positives and three negatives about fans of the opposing team. You saw the most common negatives earlier, but they were able to come up with some positives, too: WHAT RED SOX FANS LIKE ABOUT YANKEES FANS WHAT YANKEES FANS LIKE ABOUT RED SOX FANS Then we randomly assigned half of them to go the extra step of reflecting on the arbitrariness of their animosity: Think and write about how Yankee fans and Red Sox fans dislike each other for reasons that are fairly arbitrary. For example, if you were born into a family of fans of the rival team, you would likely also be a fan of them today.

Even if people aren’t on guard from the start, they’re quick to put their defenses up when their attitudes are challenged. Getting through to them requires more than just telling them that their views are arbitrary. A key step is getting them to do some counterfactual thinking: helping them consider what they’d believe if they were living in an alternative reality. In psychology, counterfactual thinking involves imagining how the circumstances of our lives could have unfolded differently. When we realize how easily we could have held different stereotypes, we might be more willing to update our views.* To activate counterfactual thinking, you might ask people questions like: How would your stereotypes be different if you’d been born Black, Hispanic, Asian, or Native American? What opinions would you hold if you’d been raised on a farm versus in a city, or in a culture on the other side of the world? What beliefs would you cling to if you lived in the 1700s? You’ve already learned from debate champions and expert negotiators that asking people questions can motivate them to rethink their conclusions. What’s different about these kinds of counterfactual questions is that they invite people to explore the origins of their own beliefs—and reconsider their stances toward other groups. People gain humility when they reflect on how different circumstances could have led them to different beliefs. They might conclude that some of their past convictions had been too simplistic and begin to question some of their negative views. That doubt could leave them more curious about groups they’ve stereotyped, and they might end up discovering some unexpected commonalities. Recently, I stumbled onto an opportunity to encourage some counterfactual thinking. A startup founder asked me to join an all-hands meeting to share insights on how to better understand other people’s personalities and our own. During our virtual fireside chat, she mentioned that she was an astrology fan and the company was full of them. I wondered if I could get some of them to see that they held inaccurate stereotypes about people based on the month in which they happened to be born. Here’s an excerpt of what happened: Me: You know we have no evidence whatsoever that horoscopes influence personality, right? Founder: That’s such a Capricorn thing to say. Me: I think I’m a Leo. I’d love to find out what evidence would change your mind. Founder: So my partner has been trying for as long as we’ve been dating. He’s given up. There’s nothing that can convince me otherwise. Me: Then you’re not thinking like a scientist. This is a religion for you. Founder: Yeah, well, maybe a little. Me: What if you’d been born in China instead of the U.S.? Some evidence just came out that if you’re a Virgo in China, you get discriminated against in hiring and also in dating. These poor Virgos are stereotyped as being difficult and ornery.* Founder: So in the West, Adam, that same discrimination happens to Scorpios. Although the founder started out resistant to my argument, after considering how she might hold different stereotypes if she lived in China, she recognized a familiar pattern. She’d seen an entire group of people mistreated as a result of the positions of the sun and the moon on the day they happened to enter the world. Realizing how unfair discrimination based on zodiac signs was, the founder ended up jumping in to help me build my case. As we wrapped up the conversation, I offered to do a follow-up discussion on the science of personality. More than a quarter of the company signed up to participate. Afterward, one of the participants wrote that “the biggest takeaway from this chat is the importance of ‘unlearning’ things to avoid being ignorant.” Having grasped how arbitrary their stereotypes were, people were now more open to rethinking their views.

Before long, the Cyclops was sharing his stereotypes of Black people. They were an inferior species, he said—they had smaller brains, which made them unintelligent, and a genetic predisposition toward violence. When Daryl pointed out that he was Black but had never shot anyone or stolen a car, the Cyclops told him his criminal gene must be latent. It hadn’t come out yet. Daryl decided to beat the Cyclops at his own game. He challenged him to name three Black serial killers. When the Cyclops couldn’t name any, Daryl rattled off a long list of well-known white serial killers and told the Cyclops that he must be one. When the Cyclops protested that he’d never killed anybody, Daryl turned his own argument against him and said that his serial-killer gene must be latent. “Well, that’s stupid,” the flustered Cyclops replied. “Well, duh!” Daryl agreed. “You’re right. What I said about you was stupid, but no more stupid than what you said about me.” The Cyclops got very quiet and changed the subject. Several months later, he told Daryl that he was still thinking about that conversation. Daryl had planted a seed of doubt and made him curious about his own beliefs. The Cyclops ended up quitting the KKK and giving his hood and his robe to Daryl. Daryl is obviously extraordinary—not only in his ability to wage a one-man war on prejudice, but also in his inclination to do so. As a general rule, it’s those with greater power who need to do more of the rethinking, both because they’re more likely to privilege their own perspectives and because their perspectives are more likely to go unquestioned. In most cases, the oppressed and marginalized have already done a great deal of contortion to fit in. Having been the target of racism since childhood, Daryl had a lifetime of legitimate reasons to harbor animosity toward white people. He was still willing to approach white supremacists with an open mind and give them the opportunity to rethink their views. But it shouldn’t have been Daryl’s responsibility to challenge white supremacists and put himself at risk. In an ideal world, the Cyclops would have taken it upon himself to educate his peers. Some other former KKK members have stepped up, working independently and with Daryl to advocate for the oppressed and reform the structures that produce oppression in the first place. As we work toward systemic change, Daryl urges us not to overlook the power of conversation. When we choose not to engage with people because of their stereotypes or prejudice, we give up on opening their minds. “We are living in space-age times, yet there are still so many of us thinking with stone-age minds,” he reflects. “Our ideology needs to catch up to our technology.” He estimates that he has helped upwards of two hundred white supremacists rethink their beliefs and leave the KKK and other neo-Nazi groups. Many of them have gone on to educate their families and friends. Daryl is quick to point out that he hasn’t directly persuaded these men to change their minds. “I didn’t convert anybody,” he says. “I gave them reason to think about their direction in life, and they thought about it, and thought, ‘I need a better path, and this is the way to go.’” Daryl doesn’t do this by preaching or prosecuting. When he begins a dialogue with white supremacists, many are initially surprised by his thoughtfulness. As they start to see him as an individual and spend more time with him, they often tap into a common identity around shared interests in topics like music. Over time, he helps them see that they joined these hate groups for reasons that weren’t their own—it was a family tradition dating back multiple generations, or someone had told them their jobs were being taken by Black men.

It was September 2018, and her baby wasn’t due until December. Just before midnight, Tobie arrived, weighing just two pounds. His body was so tiny that his head could fit in the palm of her hand, and Marie-Hélène was terrified that he wouldn’t survive. Tobie spent only a few seconds in her arms before he was rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit. He needed a mask to breathe and was soon taken to surgery for internal bleeding. It would be months before he was allowed to go home. While Tobie was still in the hospital, Marie-Hélène was shopping for diapers when she saw a headline about measles spreading in her province of Quebec. She hadn’t had Tobie vaccinated. It wasn’t even a question—he seemed too fragile. She hadn’t vaccinated her three other children, either; it wasn’t the norm in her community. Her friends and neighbors took it for granted that vaccines were dangerous and passed around horror stories about their side effects. Still, the fact remained: Quebec had already had two serious measles outbreaks that decade. Today in the developed world, measles is on the rise for the first time in at least half a century, and its mortality rate is around one in a thousand. In the developing world, it’s closer to one in a hundred. Estimates suggest that from 2016 to 2018, measles deaths spiked worldwide by 58 percent, with over a hundred thousand casualties. These deaths could have been prevented by the vaccine, which has saved roughly 20 million lives in the past two decades. Although epidemiologists recommend two doses of the measles vaccine and a minimum immunization rate of 95 percent, around the globe only 85 percent of people get the first dose and just 67 percent continue to the second. Many of those who skip the shot simply do not believe in the science. Government officials have tried to prosecute the problem, some warning that the unvaccinated could be fined up to a thousand dollars and sentenced to jail for up to six months. Many schools shut their doors to unvaccinated children, and one county even banned them from enclosed public places. When such measures failed to solve the problem, public officials turned to preaching. Since people held unfounded fears about vaccines, it was time to educate them with a dose of the truth. The results were often disappointing. In a pair of experiments in Germany, introducing people to the research on vaccine safety backfired: they ended up seeing vaccines as riskier. Similarly, when Americans read accounts of the dangers of measles, saw pictures of children suffering from it, or learned of an infant who nearly died from it, their interest in vaccination didn’t rise at all. And when they were informed that there was no evidence that the measles vaccine causes autism, those who already had concerns actually became less interested in vaccinating. It seemed that no logical argument or data-driven explanation could shake their conviction that vaccines were unsafe. This is a common problem in persuasion: what doesn’t sway us can make our beliefs stronger. Much like a vaccine inoculates our physical immune system against a virus, the act of resistance fortifies our psychological immune system. Refuting a point of view produces antibodies against future influence attempts. We become more certain of our opinions and less curious about alternative views. Counterarguments no longer surprise us or stump us—we have our rebuttals ready. Marie-Hélène Étienne-Rousseau had been through that journey. Visits to the doctor with her older kids followed a familiar script. The doctor extolled the benefits of vaccines, warned her about the risks of refusing them, and stuck to generic messaging instead of engaging with her particular questions.

It was common for therapists and counselors to accuse their substance-abusing clients of being pathological liars who were living in denial. That didn’t track with what Miller was seeing up close in his own work treating people with alcohol problems, where preaching and prosecuting typically boomeranged. “People who drink too much are usually aware of it,” Miller told me. “If you try to persuade them that they do drink too much or need to make a change, you evoke resistance, and they are less likely to change.” Instead of attacking or demeaning his clients, Miller started asking them questions and listening to their answers. Soon afterward, he published a paper on his philosophy, which found its way into the hands of Stephen Rollnick, a young nurse trainee working in addiction treatment. A few years later, the two happened to meet in Australia and realized that what they were exploring was much bigger than just a new approach to treatment. It was an entirely different way of helping people change. Together, they developed the core principles of a practice called motivational interviewing. The central premise is that we can rarely motivate someone else to change. We’re better off helping them find their own motivation to change. Let’s say you’re a student at Hogwarts, and you’re worried your uncle is a fan of Voldemort. A motivational interview might go like this: You: I’d love to better understand your feelings about He Who Must Not Be Named. Uncle: Well, he’s the most powerful wizard alive. Also, his followers promised me a fancy title. You: Interesting. Is there anything you dislike about him? Uncle: Hmm. I’m not crazy about all the murdering. You: Well, nobody’s perfect. Uncle: Yeah, but the killing is really bad. You: Sounds like you have some reservations about Voldemort. What’s stopped you from abandoning him? Uncle: I’m afraid he might direct the murdering toward me. You: That’s a reasonable fear. I’ve felt it too. I’m curious: are there any principles that matter so deeply to you that you’d be willing to take that risk? Motivational interviewing starts with an attitude of humility and curiosity. We don’t know what might motivate someone else to change, but we’re genuinely eager to find out. The goal isn’t to tell people what to do; it’s to help them break out of overconfidence cycles and see new possibilities. Our role is to hold up a mirror so they can see themselves more clearly, and then empower them to examine their beliefs and behaviors*.* That can activate a rethinking cycle, in which people approach their own views more scientifically. They develop more humility about their knowledge, doubt in their convictions, and curiosity about alternative points of view. The process of motivational interviewing involves three key techniques: Asking open-ended questions Engaging in reflective listening Affirming the person’s desire and ability to change As Marie-Hélène was getting ready to take Tobie home, the vaccine whisperer the nurses called was a neonatologist and researcher named Arnaud Gagneur. His specialty was applying the techniques of motivational interviewing to vaccination discussions. When Arnaud sat down with Marie-Hélène, he didn’t judge her for not vaccinating her children, nor did he order her to change. He was like a scientist or “a less abrasive Socrates,” as journalist Eric Boodman described him in reporting on their meeting. Arnaud told Marie-Hélène he was afraid of what might happen if Tobie got the measles, but he accepted her decision and wanted to understand it better. For over an hour, he asked her open-ended questions about how she had reached the decision not to vaccinate. He listened carefully to her answers, acknowledging that the world is full of confusing information about vaccine safety. At the end of the discussion, Arnaud reminded","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:20:1","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"BEYOND THE CLINIC Years ago I got a call asking for help from a biotechnology startup. The CEO, Jeff, was a scientist by training; he liked to have all the necessary data before making a decision. After more than a year and a half at the helm, he still hadn’t rolled out a vision for the company, and it was in danger of failing. A trio of consultants tried to convince him to offer some direction, and he fired them all. Before the head of HR threw in the towel, she threw a Hail Mary pass and contacted an academic. It was the perfect time for a motivational interview: Jeff seemed reluctant to change, and I had no idea why. When we met, I decided to see if I could help him find his motivation to change. Here are the pivotal moments from our conversation: Me: I really enjoy being the guy who gets hired after three consultants get fired. I’d love to hear how they screwed up. Jeff: The first consultant gave me answers instead of asking questions. That was arrogant: how could he solve a problem before he’d even taken the time to understand it? The next two did a better job learning from me, but they still ended up trying to tell me how to do my job. Me: So why did you bother to bring in another outsider? Jeff: I’m looking for some fresh ideas on leadership. Me: It’s not my place to tell you how to lead. What does leadership mean to you? Jeff: Making systemic decisions, having a well-thought-out strategy. Me: Are there any leaders you admire for those qualities? Jeff: Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs. That was a turning point. In motivational interviewing, there’s a distinction between sustain talk and change talk. Sustain talk is commentary about maintaining the status quo. Change talk is referencing a desire, ability, need, or commitment to make adjustments. When contemplating a change, many people are ambivalent—they have some reasons to consider it but also some reasons to stay the course. Miller and Rollnick suggest asking about and listening for change talk, and then posing some questions about why and how they might change. Say you have a friend who mentions a desire to stop smoking. You might respond by asking why she’s considering quitting. If she says a doctor recommended it, you might follow up by inquiring about her own motivations: what does she think of the idea? If she offers a reason why she’s determined to stop, you might ask what her first step toward quitting could be. “Change talk is a golden thread,” clinical psychologist Theresa Moyers says. “What you need to do is you need to pick that thread up and pull it.” So that’s what I did with Jeff. Me: What do you appreciate most about the leaders you named? Jeff: They all had vivid visions. They inspired people to achieve extraordinary things. Me: Interesting. If Steve Jobs were in your shoes right now, what do you think he’d do? Jeff: He’d probably get his leadership team fired up about a bold idea and create a reality distortion field to make it seem possible. Maybe I should do that, too. A few weeks later, Jeff stood up at an executive off-site to deliver his first-ever vision speech. When I heard about it, I was beaming with pride: I had conquered my inner logic bully and led him to find his own motivation. Unfortunately, the board ended up shutting down the company anyway. Jeff’s speech had fallen flat. He stumbled through notes on a napkin and didn’t stir up enthusiasm about the company’s direction. I had overlooked a key step—helping him think about how to execute the change effectively. There’s a fourth technique of motivational interviewing, which is often recommended for the end of a conversation and for transition points: summarizing. The idea is to explain your understanding of other people’s reasons for change, to check on whether you’ve missed or misrepresented anything, and to inquire about their plans and possible next steps. The objective is not to be a leader or a follower, but a guide.

She was no stranger to a long walk: growing up in northern Uganda, she walked four miles each way to school. She subsisted on one meal a day in a communal homestead where her uncle had eight wives. Now she had made it all the way to the Ugandan Parliament, and she was undertaking a challenge that none of her colleagues would brave: trying to make peace with a warlord. Joseph Kony was the leader of the Lord’s Resistance Army. He and his rebel group would eventually be held responsible for murdering over a hundred thousand people, abducting over thirty thousand children, and displacing over two million Ugandans. In the early 1990s, Betty convinced the Ugandan president to send her in to see if she could stop the violence. When Betty finally made contact with the rebels after months of effort, they were insulted at the prospect of negotiating with a woman. Yet Betty negotiated her way into getting permission to meet Kony himself. Soon he was referring to her as Mummy, and he even agreed to leave the jungle to start peace talks. Although the peace effort didn’t succeed, opening Kony’s mind to conversation was a remarkable accomplishment in itself.* For her efforts to end the violence, Betty was named Uganda’s Woman of the Year. When I spoke to her recently, I asked how she had succeeded in getting through to Kony and his people. The key, she explained, was not persuading or even coaxing, but listening. Listening well is more than a matter of talking less. It’s a set of skills in asking and responding. It starts with showing more interest in other people’s interests rather than trying to judge their status or prove our own. We can all get better at asking “truly curious questions that don’t have the hidden agenda of fixing, saving, advising, convincing or correcting,” journalist Kate Murphy writes, and helping to “facilitate the clear expression of another person’s thoughts.”* When we’re trying to get people to change, that can be a difficult task. Even if we have the best intentions, we can easily slip into the mode of a preacher perched on a pulpit, a prosecutor making a closing argument, or a politician giving a stump speech. We’re all vulnerable to the “righting reflex,” as Miller and Rollnick describe it—the desire to fix problems and offer answers. A skilled motivational interviewer resists the righting reflex—although people want a doctor to fix their broken bones, when it comes to the problems in their heads, they often want sympathy rather than solutions. That’s what Betty Bigombe set out to provide in Uganda. She started traveling through rural areas to visit camps for internally displaced people. She figured some might have relatives in Joseph Kony’s army and might know something of his whereabouts. Although she hadn’t been trained in motivational interviewing, she intuitively understood the philosophy. At each camp, she announced to people that she wasn’t there to lecture them, but to listen to them. Her curiosity and confident humility caught the Ugandans by surprise. Other peacemakers had come in ordering them to stop fighting. They had preached about their own plans for conflict resolution and prosecuted the past efforts that failed. Now Betty, a politician by profession, wasn’t telling them what to do. She just sat patiently for hours in front of a bonfire, taking notes and chiming in from time to time to ask questions. “If you want to call me names, feel free to do so,” she said. “If you want me to leave, I will.” To demonstrate her commitment to peace, Betty stayed in the camps even though they lacked sufficient food and proper sanitation. She invited people to air their grievances and suggest remedial measures to be taken. They told her that it was rare and refreshing for an outsider to give them the opportunity to share their views. She empowered them to generate their own solutio","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:20:3","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"CHAPTER 8 ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:21:0","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"Charged Conversations ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:22:0","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"Depolarizing Our Divided Discussions When conflict is cliché, complexity is breaking news. —amanda ripley Eager to have a jaw-clenching, emotionally fraught argument about abortion? How about immigration, the death penalty, or climate change? If you think you can handle it, head for the second floor of a brick building on the Columbia University campus in New York. It’s the home of the Difficult Conversations Lab. If you’re brave enough to visit, you’ll be matched up with a stranger who strongly disagrees with your views on a controversial topic. You’ll be given just twenty minutes to discuss the issue, and then you’ll both have to decide whether you’ve aligned enough to write and sign a joint statement on your shared views around abortion laws. If you’re able to do so—no small feat—your statement will be posted on a public forum. For two decades, the psychologist who runs the lab, Peter T. Coleman, has been bringing people together to talk about polarizing issues. His mission is to reverse-engineer the successful conversations and then experiment with recipes to make more of them. To put you in the right mindset before you begin your conversation about abortion, Peter gives you and the stranger a news article about another divisive issue: gun control. What you don’t know is that there are different versions of the gun control article, and which one you read is going to have a major impact on whether you land on the same page about abortion. If the gun control article covers both sides of the issue, making a balanced case for both gun rights and gun legislation, you and your adversary have a decent chance at reaching consensus on abortion. In one of Peter’s experiments, after reading a “both-sides” article, 46 percent of pairs were able to find enough common ground to draft and sign a statement together. That’s a remarkable result. But Peter went on to do something far more impressive. He randomly assigned some pairs to read another version of the same article, which led 100 percent of them to generate and sign a joint statement about abortion laws. That version of the article featured the same information but presented it differently. Instead of describing the issue as a black-and-white disagreement between two sides, the article framed the debate as a complex problem with many shades of gray, representing a number of different viewpoints. At the turn of the last century, the great hope for the internet was that it would expose us to different views. But as the web welcomed a few billion fresh voices and vantage points into the conversation, it also became a weapon of misinformation and disinformation. By the 2016 elections, as the problem of political polarization became more extreme and more visible, the solution seemed obvious to me. We needed to burst filter bubbles in our news feeds and shatter echo chambers in our networks. If we could just show people the other side of an issue, they would open their minds and become more informed. Peter’s research challenges that assumption. We now know that where complicated issues are concerned, seeing the opinions of the other side is not enough. Social media platforms have exposed us to them, but they haven’t changed our minds. Knowing another side exists isn’t sufficient to leave preachers doubting whether they’re on the right side of morality, prosecutors questioning whether they’re on the right side of the case, or politicians wondering whether they’re on the right side of history. Hearing an opposing opinion doesn’t necessarily motivate you to rethink your own stance; it makes it easier for you to stick to your guns (or your gun bans). Presenting two extremes isn’t the solution; it’s part of the polarization problem. Psychologists have a name for this: binary bias. It’s a basic human tendency to seek clarity and closure by simplifying a complex continuum into two categories.

It won the Academy Award for Best Documentary and spawned a wave of activism, motivating businesses to go green and governments to pass legislation and sign landmark agreements to protect the planet. History teaches us that it sometimes takes a combination of preaching, prosecuting, and politicking to fuel that kind of dramatic swing. Yet by 2018, only 59 percent of Americans saw climate change as a major threat—and 16 percent believed it wasn’t a threat at all. Across many countries in Western Europe and Southeast Asia, higher percentages of the populations had opened their minds to the evidence that climate change is a dire problem. In the past decade in the United States, beliefs about climate change have hardly budged. This thorny issue is a natural place to explore how we can bring more complexity into our conversations. Fundamentally, that involves drawing attention to the nuances that often get overlooked. It starts with seeking and spotlighting shades of gray. A fundamental lesson of desirability bias is that our beliefs are shaped by our motivations. What we believe depends on what we want to believe. Emotionally, it can be unsettling for anyone to admit that all life as we know it might be in danger, but Americans have some additional reasons to be dubious about climate change. Politically, climate change has been branded in the United States as a liberal issue; in some conservative circles, merely acknowledging the fact that it might exist puts people on a fast track to exile. There’s evidence that higher levels of education predict heightened concern about climate change among Democrats but dampened concern among Republicans. Economically, we remain confident that America will be more resilient in response to a changing climate than most of the world, and we’re reluctant to sacrifice our current ways of achieving prosperity. These deep-seated beliefs are hard to change. As a psychologist, I want to zoom in on another factor. It’s one we can all control: the way we communicate about climate change. Many people believe that preaching with passion and conviction is necessary for persuasion. A clear example is Al Gore. When he narrowly lost the U.S. presidential election in 2000, one of the knocks against him was his energy—or lack thereof. People called him dry. Boring. Robotic. Fast-forward a few years: his film was riveting and his own platform skills had evolved dramatically. In 2016, when I watched Gore speak in the red circle at TED, his language was vivid, his voice pulsated with emotion, and his passion literally dripped off him in the form of sweat. If a robot was ever controlling his brain, it short-circuited and left the human in charge. “Some still doubt that we have the will to act,” he boomed, “but I say the will to act is itself a renewable resource.” The audience erupted in a standing ovation, and afterward he was called the Elvis of TED. If it’s not his communication style that’s failing to reach people, what is? At TED, Gore was preaching to the choir: his audience was heavily progressive. For audiences with more varied beliefs, his language hasn’t always resonated. In An Inconvenient Truth, Gore contrasted the “truth” with claims made by “so-called skeptics.” In a 2010 op-ed, he contrasted scientists with “climate deniers.” This is binary bias in action. It presumes that the world is divided into two sides: believers and nonbelievers. Only one side can be right, because there is only one truth. I don’t blame Al Gore for taking that position; he was presenting rigorous data and representing the consensus of the scientific community. Because he was a recovering politician, seeing two sides to an issue must have been second nature. But when the only available options are black and white, it’s natural to slip into a mentality of us versus them and to focus on the sides over the science.

One key step is to include caveats. It’s rare that a single study or even a series of studies is conclusive. Researchers typically feature multiple paragraphs about the limitations of each study in their articles. We see them less as holes in our work and more as portholes to future discoveries. When we share the findings with nonscientists, though, we sometimes gloss over these caveats. That’s a mistake, according to recent research. In a series of experiments, psychologists demonstrated that when news reports about science included caveats, they succeeded in capturing readers’ interest and keeping their minds open. Take a study suggesting that a poor diet accelerates aging. Readers were just as engaged in the story—but more flexible in their beliefs—when it mentioned that scientists remained hesitant to draw strong causal conclusions given the number of factors that can affect aging. It even helped just to note that scientists believed more work needed to be done in this area. We can also convey complexity by highlighting contingencies. Every empirical finding raises unanswered questions about when and where results will be replicated, nullified, or reversed. Contingencies are all the places and populations where an effect may change. Consider diversity: although headlines often say “Diversity is good,” the evidence is full of contingencies. Although diversity of background and thought has the potential to help groups think more broadly and process information more deeply, that potential is realized in some situations but not others. New research reveals that people are more likely to promote diversity and inclusion when the message is more nuanced (and more accurate): “Diversity is good, but it isn’t easy.”* Acknowledging complexity doesn’t make speakers and writers less convincing; it makes them more credible. It doesn’t lose viewers and readers; it maintains their engagement while stoking their curiosity. In social science, rather than cherry-picking information to fit our existing narratives, we’re trained to ask whether we should rethink and revise those narratives. When we find evidence that doesn’t fit neatly into our belief systems, we’re expected to share it anyway.* In some of my past writing for the public, though, I regret not having done enough to emphasize areas where evidence was incomplete or conflicting. I sometimes shied away from discussing mixed results because I didn’t want to leave readers confused. Research suggests that many writers fall into the same trap, caught up in trying to “maintain a consistent narrative rather than an accurate record.” A fascinating example is the divide around emotional intelligence. On one extreme is Daniel Goleman, who popularized the concept. He preaches that emotional intelligence matters more for performance than cognitive ability (IQ) and accounts for “nearly 90 percent” of success in leadership jobs. At the other extreme is Jordan Peterson, writing that “There is NO SUCH THING AS EQ” and prosecuting emotional intelligence as “a fraudulent concept, a fad, a convenient band-wagon, a corporate marketing scheme.” Both men hold doctorates in psychology, but neither seems particularly interested in creating an accurate record. If Peterson had bothered to read the comprehensive meta-analyses of studies spanning nearly two hundred jobs, he’d have discovered that—contrary to his claims—emotional intelligence is real and it does matter. Emotional intelligence tests predict performance even after controlling for IQ and personality. If Goleman hadn’t ignored those same data, he’d have learned that if you want to predict performance across jobs, IQ is more than twice as important as emotional intelligence (which accounts for only 3 to 8 percent of performance). I think they’re both missing the point.

In theory, putting ourselves in another person’s shoes enables us to walk in lockstep with them. In practice, though, it’s not that simple. In a pair of experiments, randomly assigning people to reflect on the intentions and interests of their political opposites made them less receptive to rethinking their own attitudes on health care and universal basic income. Across twenty-five experiments, imagining other people’s perspectives failed to elicit more accurate insights—and occasionally made participants more confident in their own inaccurate judgments. Perspective-taking consistently fails because we’re terrible mind readers. We’re just guessing. If we don’t understand someone, we can’t have a eureka moment by imagining his perspective. Polls show that Democrats underestimate the number of Republicans who recognize the prevalence of racism and sexism—and Republicans underestimate the number of Democrats who are proud to be Americans and oppose open borders. The greater the distance between us and an adversary, the more likely we are to oversimplify their actual motives and invent explanations that stray far from their reality. What works is not perspective-taking but perspective-seeking: actually talking to people to gain insight into the nuances of their views. That’s what good scientists do: instead of drawing conclusions about people based on minimal clues, they test their hypotheses by striking up conversations. For a long time, I believed that the best way to make those conversations less polarizing was to leave emotions out of them. If only we could keep our feelings off the table, we’d all be more open to rethinking. Then I read evidence that complicated my thinking. It turns out that even if we disagree strongly with someone on a social issue, when we discover that she cares deeply about the issue, we trust her more. We might still dislike her, but we see her passion for a principle as a sign of integrity. We reject the belief but grow to respect the person behind it. It can help to make that respect explicit at the start of a conversation. In one experiment, if an ideological opponent merely began by acknowledging that “I have a lot of respect for people like you who stand by their principles,” people were less likely to see her as an adversary—and showed her more generosity. When Peter Coleman brings people together in his Difficult Conversations Lab, he plays them the recording of their discussions afterward. What he wants to learn is how they were feeling, moment by moment, as they listen to themselves. After studying over five hundred of these conversations, he found that the unproductive ones feature a more limited set of both positive and negative emotions, as illustrated below in the image on the left. People get trapped in emotional simplicity, with one or two dominant feelings. As you can see with the duo on the right, the productive conversations cover a much more varied spectrum of emotions. They’re not less emotional—they’re more emotionally complex. At one point, people might be angry about the other person’s views, but by the next minute they’re curious to learn more. Soon they could be shifting into anxiety and then excitement about considering a new perspective. Sometimes they even stumble into the joy of being wrong. In a productive conversation, people treat their feelings as a rough draft. Like art, emotions are works in progress. It rarely serves us well to frame our first sketch. As we gain perspective, we revise what we feel. Sometimes we even start over from scratch. What stands in the way of rethinking isn’t the expression of emotion; it’s a restricted range of emotion. So how do we infuse our charged conversations with greater emotional variety—and thereby greater potential for mutual understanding and rethinking? It helps to remember that we can fall victim to binary bias with emotions","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:23:3","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"CHAPTER 9 ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:24:0","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"Rewriting the Textbook ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:25:0","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"Teaching Students to Question Knowledge No schooling was allowed to interfere with my education. —grant allen Adecade ago, if you had told Erin McCarthy she would become a teacher, she would have laughed. When she graduated from college, the last thing she wanted to do was teach. She was fascinated by history but bored by her social studies classes. Searching for a way to breathe life into overlooked objects and forgotten events, Erin started her career working in museums. Before long, she found herself writing a resource manual for teachers, leading school tours, and engaging students in interactive programs. She realized that the enthusiasm she saw on field trips was missing in too many classrooms, and she decided to do something about it. For the past eight years, Erin has taught social studies in the Milwaukee area. Her mission is to cultivate curiosity about the past, but also to motivate students to update their knowledge in the present. In 2020, she was named Wisconsin’s Teacher of the Year. One day, an eighth grader complained that the reading assignment from a history textbook was inaccurate. If you’re a teacher, that kind of criticism could be a nightmare. Using an outdated textbook would be a sign that you don’t know your material, and it would be embarrassing if your students noticed the error before you did. But Erin had assigned that particular reading intentionally. She collects old history books because she enjoys seeing how the stories we tell change over time, and she decided to give her students part of a textbook from 1940. Some of them just accepted the information it presented at face value. Through years of education, they had come to take it for granted that textbooks told the truth. Others were shocked by errors and omissions. It was ingrained in their minds that their readings were filled with incontrovertible facts. The lesson led them to start thinking like scientists and questioning what they were learning: whose story was included, whose was excluded, and what were they missing if only one or two perspectives were shared? After opening her students’ eyes to the fact that knowledge can evolve, Erin’s next step was to show them that it’s always evolving. To set up a unit on expansion in the West, she created her own textbook section describing what it’s like to be a middle-school student today. All the protagonists were women and girls, and all the generic pronouns were female. In the first year she introduced the material, a student raised his hand to point out that the boys were missing. “But there’s one boy,” Erin replied. “Boys were around. They just weren’t doing anything important.” It was an aha moment for the student: he suddenly realized what it was like for an entire group to be marginalized for hundreds of years. My favorite assignment of Erin’s is her final one. As a passionate champion of inquiry-based learning, she sends her eighth graders off to do self-directed research in which they inspect, investigate, interrogate, and interpret. Their active learning culminates in a group project: they pick a chapter from their textbook, choosing a time period that interests them and a theme in history that they see as underrepresented. Then they go off to rewrite it. One group took on the civil rights chapter for failing to cover the original March on Washington, which was called off at the last minute in the early 1940s but inspired Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic march two decades later. Other groups revised the chapter on World War II to include the infantry regiments of Hispanic soldiers and second-generation Japanese soldiers who fought for the U.S. Army. “It’s a huge light-bulb moment,” Erin told me. Even if you’re not a teacher by profession, you probably have roles in which you spend time educating others—whether as a parent, a mentor, a friend, or a colleague. In fact, every time we try to help someone think again, we’re doing a kind of education.

Long before it ever occurred to me to be curious about the cosmos, my teachers started demystifying it in kindergarten. I often wonder how I would have felt if I was a teenager when I first learned that we don’t live on a static, flat disc, but on a spinning, moving sphere. I hope I would have been stunned, and that disbelief would have quickly given way to curiosity and eventually the awe of discovery and the joy of being wrong. I also suspect it would have been a life-changing lesson in confident humility. If I could be that mistaken about what was under my own two feet, how many other so-called truths were actually question marks? Sure, I knew that many earlier generations of humans had gotten it wrong, but there’s a huge difference between learning about other people’s false beliefs and actually learning to unbelieve things ourselves. I realize this thought experiment is wildly impractical. It’s hard enough to keep kids in the dark about Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy. Even if we could pull off such a delay, there’s a risk that some students would seize and freeze on what they learned early on. They could become trapped in an overconfidence cycle where pride in false knowledge fuels conviction, and confirmation and desirability biases lead to validation. Before you know it, we might have a whole nation of flat-earthers. Evidence shows that if false scientific beliefs aren’t addressed in elementary school, they become harder to change later. “Learning counterintuitive scientific ideas [is] akin to becoming a fluent speaker of a second language,” psychologist Deborah Kelemen writes. It’s “a task that becomes increasingly difficult the longer it is delayed, and one that is almost never achieved with only piecemeal instruction and infrequent practice.” That’s what kids really need: frequent practice at unlearning, especially when it comes to the mechanisms of how cause and effect work. In the field of history education, there’s a growing movement to ask questions that don’t have a single right answer. In a curriculum developed at Stanford, high school students are encouraged to critically examine what really caused the Spanish-American War, whether the New Deal was a success, and why the Montgomery bus boycott was a watershed moment. Some teachers even send students out to interview people with whom they disagree. The focus is less on being right, and more on building the skills to consider different views and argue productively about them. That doesn’t mean all interpretations are accepted as valid. When the son of a Holocaust survivor came to her class, Erin McCarthy told her students that some people denied the existence of the Holocaust, and taught them to examine the evidence and reject those false claims. This is part of a broader movement to teach kids to think like fact-checkers: the guidelines include (1) “interrogate information instead of simply consuming it,” (2) “reject rank and popularity as a proxy for reliability,” and (3) “understand that the sender of information is often not its source.” These principles are valuable beyond the classroom. At our family dinner table, we sometimes hold myth-busting discussions. My wife and I have shared how we learned in school that Pluto was a planet (not true anymore) and Columbus discovered America (never true). Our kids have taught us that King Tut probably didn’t die in a chariot accident and gleefully explained that when sloths do their version of a fart, the gas comes not from their behinds but from their mouths. Rethinking needs to become a regular habit. Unfortunately, traditional methods of education don’t always allow students to form that habit.

The first session is on statics; it’s a lecture. The second is on fluids, and it’s an active-learning session. One of your roommates has a different, equally popular instructor who does the opposite—using active learning for statics and lecturing on fluids. In both cases the content and the handouts are identical; the only difference is the delivery method. During the lecture the instructor presents slides, gives explanations, does demonstrations, and solves sample problems, and you take notes on the handouts. In the active-learning session, instead of doing the example problems himself, the instructor sends the class off to figure them out in small groups, wandering around to ask questions and offer tips before walking the class through the solution. At the end, you fill out a survey. In this experiment the topic doesn’t matter: the teaching method is what shapes your experience. I expected active learning to win the day, but the data suggest that you and your roommate will both enjoy the subject more when it’s delivered by lecture. You’ll also rate the instructor who lectures as more effective—and you’ll be more likely to say you wish all your physics courses were taught that way. Upon reflection, the appeal of dynamic lectures shouldn’t be surprising. For generations, people have admired the rhetorical eloquence of poets like Maya Angelou, politicians like John F. Kennedy Jr. and Ronald Reagan, preachers like Martin Luther King Jr., and teachers like Richard Feynman. Today we live in a golden age of spellbinding speaking, where great orators engage and educate from platforms with unprecedented reach. Creatives used to share their methods in small communities; now they can accumulate enough YouTube and Instagram subscribers to populate a small country. Pastors once gave sermons to hundreds at church; now they can reach hundreds of thousands over the internet in megachurches. Professors used to teach small enough classes that they could spend individual time with each student; now their lessons can be broadcast to millions through online courses. It’s clear that these lectures are entertaining and informative. The question is whether they’re the ideal method of teaching. In the physics experiment, the students took tests to gauge how much they had learned about statics and fluids. Despite enjoying the lectures more, they actually gained more knowledge and skill from the active-learning session. It required more mental effort, which made it less fun but led to deeper understanding. For a long time, I believed that we learn more when we’re having fun. This research convinced me I was wrong. It also reminded me of my favorite physics teacher, who got stellar reviews for letting us play Ping-Pong in class, but didn’t quite make the coefficient of friction stick. Active learning has impact far beyond physics. A meta-analysis compared the effects of lecturing and active learning on students’ mastery of the material, cumulating 225 studies with over 46,000 undergraduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Active-learning methods included group problem solving, worksheets, and tutorials. On average, students scored half a letter grade worse under traditional lecturing than through active learning—and students were 1.55 times more likely to fail in classes with traditional lecturing. The researchers estimate that if the students who failed in lecture courses had participated in active learning, more than $3.5 million in tuition could have been saved. It’s not hard to see why a boring lecture would fail, but even captivating lectures can fall short for a less obvious, more concerning reason.

It was taught by a philosopher named Robert Nozick. One of his ideas became famous thanks to the movie The Matrix: in the 1970s, Nozick introduced a thought experiment about whether people would choose to enter an “experience machine” that could provide infinite pleasure but remove them from real life.* In his classroom, Nozick created his own version of an experience machine: he insisted on teaching a new class every year. “I do my thinking through the courses I give,” he said. Nozick taught one course on truth; another on philosophy and neuroscience; a third on Socrates, Buddha, and Jesus; a fourth on thinking about thinking; and a fifth on the Russian Revolution. In four decades of teaching, he taught only one class a second time: it was on the good life. “Presenting a completely polished and worked-out view doesn’t give students a feel for what it’s like to do original work in philosophy and to see it happen, to catch on to doing it,” he explained. Sadly, before I could take one of his courses, he died of cancer. What I found so inspiring about Nozick’s approach was that he wasn’t content for students to learn from him. He wanted them to learn with him. Every time he tackled a new topic, he would have the opportunity to rethink his existing views on it. He was a remarkable role model for changing up our familiar methods of teaching—and learning. When I started teaching, I wanted to adopt some of his principles. I wasn’t prepared to inflict an entire semester of half-baked ideas on my students, so I set a benchmark: every year I would aim to throw out 20 percent of my class and replace it with new material. If I was doing new thinking every year, we could all start rethinking together. With the other 80 percent of the material, though, I found myself failing. I was teaching a semester-long class on organizational behavior for juniors and seniors. When I introduced evidence, I wasn’t giving them the space to rethink it. After years of wrestling with this problem, it dawned on me that I could create a new assignment to teach rethinking. I assigned students to work in small groups to record their own mini-podcasts or mini–TED talks. Their charge was to question a popular practice, to champion an idea that went against the grain of conventional wisdom, or to challenge principles covered in class. As they started working on the project, I noticed a surprising pattern. The students who struggled the most were the straight-A students—the perfectionists. It turns out that although perfectionists are more likely than their peers to ace school, they don’t perform any better than their colleagues at work. This tracks with evidence that, across a wide range of industries, grades are not a strong predictor of job performance. Achieving excellence in school often requires mastering old ways of thinking. Building an influential career demands new ways of thinking. In a classic study of highly accomplished architects, the most creative ones graduated with a B average. Their straight-A counterparts were so determined to be right that they often failed to take the risk of rethinking the orthodoxy. A similar pattern emerged in a study of students who graduated at the top of their class. “Valedictorians aren’t likely to be the future’s visionaries,” education researcher Karen Arnold explains. “They typically settle into the system instead of shaking it up.” That’s what I saw with my straight-A students: they were terrified of being wrong. To give them a strong incentive to take some risks, I made the assignment worth 20 percent of their final grade. I had changed the rules: now they were being rewarded for rethinking instead of regurgitating. I wasn’t sure if that incentive would work until I reviewed the work of a trio of straight-A students. They gave their mini–TED talk about the problems with TED talks, pointing out the risks of reinforcing short atte","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:26:3","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"JACK OF ROUGH DRAFTS, MASTER OF CRAFTS When I asked a handful of education pioneers to name the best teacher of rethinking they’ve ever encountered, I kept hearing the same name: Ron Berger. If you invited Ron over for dinner, he’s the kind of person who would notice that one of your chairs was broken, ask if you had some tools handy, and fix it on the spot. For most of his career, Ron was a public-elementary-school teacher in rural Massachusetts. His nurse, his plumber, and his local firefighters were all former students. During the summers and on weekends, he worked as a carpenter. Ron has devoted his life to teaching students an ethic of excellence. Mastering a craft, in his experience, is about constantly revising our thinking. Hands-on craftsmanship is the foundation for his classroom philosophy. Ron wanted his students to experience the joy of discovery, so he didn’t start by teaching them established knowledge. He began the school year by presenting them with “grapples”—problems to work through in phases. The approach was think-pair-share: the kids started individually, updated their ideas in small groups, and then presented their thoughts to the rest of the class, arriving at solutions together. Instead of introducing existing taxonomies of animals, for example, Ron had them develop their own categories first. Some students classified animals by whether they walked on land, swam in water, or flew through the air; others arranged them according to color, size, or diet. The lesson was that scientists always have many options, and their frameworks are useful in some ways but arbitrary in others. When students confront complex problems, they often feel confused. A teacher’s natural impulse is to rescue them as quickly as possible so they don’t feel lost or incompetent. Yet psychologists find that one of the hallmarks of an open mind is responding to confusion with curiosity and interest. One student put it eloquently: “I need time for my confusion.” Confusion can be a cue that there’s new territory to be explored or a fresh puzzle to be solved. Ron wasn’t content to deliver lessons that erased confusion. He wanted students to embrace confusion. His vision was for them to become leaders of their own learning, much like they would in “do it yourself” (DIY) craft projects. He started encouraging students to think like young scientists: they would identify problems, develop hypotheses, and design their own experiments to test them. His sixth graders went around the community to test local homes for radon gas. His third graders created their own maps of amphibian habitats. His first graders got their own group of snails to take care of, and went on to test which of over 140 foods they liked—and whether they preferred hot or cold, dark or light, and wet or dry environments. For architecture and engineering lessons, Ron had his students create blueprints for a house. When he required them to do at least four different drafts, other teachers warned him that younger students would become discouraged. Ron disagreed—he had already tested the concept with kindergarteners and first graders in art. Rather than asking them to simply draw a house, he announced, “We’ll be doing four different versions of a drawing of a house.” Some students didn’t stop there; many wound up deciding to do eight or ten drafts. The students had a support network of classmates cheering them on in their efforts. “Quality means rethinking, reworking, and polishing,” Ron reflects. “They need to feel they will be celebrated, not ridiculed, for going back to the drawing board. . . . They soon began complaining if I didn’t allow them to do more than one version.” Ron wanted to teach his students to revise their thinking based on input from others, so he turned the classroom into a challenge network. Every week—and sometimes every day—the entire class would do a critique session. One format was a gallery critique: Ron put everyone’s work on display, sent students aro","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:26:4","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"CHAPTER 10 ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:27:0","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"That’s Not the Way We’ve Always Done It ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:28:0","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"Building Cultures of Learning at Work If only it weren’t for the people . . . earth would be an engineer’s paradise. —kurt vonnegut As an avid scuba diver, Luca Parmitano was familiar with the risks of drowning. He just didn’t realize it could happen in outer space. Luca had just become the youngest astronaut ever to take a long trip to the International Space Station. In July 2013, the thirty-six-year-old Italian astronaut completed his first spacewalk, spending six hours running experiments, moving equipment, and setting up power and data cables. Now, a week later, Luca and another astronaut, Chris Cassidy, were heading out for a second walk to continue their work and do some maintenance. As they prepared to leave the airlock, they could see the Earth 250 miles below. After forty-four minutes in space, Luca felt something strange: the back of his head seemed to be wet. He wasn’t sure where the water was coming from. It wasn’t just a nuisance; it could cut off communication by shorting out his microphone or earphones. He reported the problem to Mission Control in Houston, and Chris asked if he was sweating. “I am sweating,” Luca said, “but it feels like a lot of water. It’s not going anywhere, it’s just in my Snoopy cap. Just FYI.” He went back to work. The officer in charge of spacewalks, Karina Eversley, knew something was wrong. That’s not normal, she thought, and quickly recruited a team of experts to compile questions for Luca. Was the amount of liquid increasing? Luca couldn’t tell. Was he sure it was water? When he stuck out his tongue to capture a few of the drops that were floating in his helmet, the taste was metallic. Mission Control made the call to terminate the spacewalk early. Luca and Chris had to split up to follow their tethers, which were routed in opposite directions. To get around an antenna, Luca flipped over. Suddenly, he couldn’t see clearly or breathe through his nose—globs of water were covering his eyes and filling his nostrils. The water was continuing to accumulate, and if it reached his mouth he could drown. His only hope was to navigate quickly back to the airlock. As the sun set, Luca was surrounded by darkness, with only a small headlight to guide him. Then his comms went down, too—he couldn’t hear himself or anyone else speak. Luca managed to find his way back to the outer hatch of the airlock, using his memory and the tension in his tether. He was still in grave danger: before he could remove his helmet, he would have to wait for Chris to close the hatch and repressurize the airlock. For several agonizing minutes of silence, it was unclear whether he would survive. When it was finally safe to remove his helmet, a quart and a half of water was in it, but Luca was alive. Months later, the incident would be called the “scariest wardrobe malfunction in NASA history.” The technical updates followed swiftly. The spacesuit engineers traced the leak to a fan/pump/separator, which they replaced moving forward. They also added a breathing tube that works like a snorkel and a pad to absorb water inside the helmet. Yet the biggest error wasn’t technical—it was human. When Luca had returned from his first spacewalk a week earlier, he had noticed some droplets of water in his helmet. He and Chris assumed they were the result of a leak in the bag that provided drinking water in his suit, and the crew in Houston agreed. Just to be safe, they replaced the bag, but that was the end of the discussion. The space station chief engineer, Chris Hansen, led the eventual investigation into what had gone wrong with Luca’s suit. “The occurrence of minor amounts of water in the helmet was normalized,” Chris told me. In the space station community, the “perception was that drink bags leak, which led to an acceptance that it was a likely explanation without digging deeper into it.” Luca’s scare wasn’t the first time that NASA’s failure at rethinking had proven disastrous.

She went into a hospital and surveyed its staff about the degree of psychological safety they experienced in their teams—could they take risks without the fear of being punished? Then she collected data on the number of medical errors each team made, tracking serious outcomes like potentially fatal doses of the wrong medication. She was surprised to find that the more psychological safety a team felt, the higher its error rates. It appeared that psychological safety could breed complacency. When trust runs deep in a team, people might not feel the need to question their colleagues or double-check their own work. But Edmondson soon recognized a major limitation of the data: the errors were all self-reported. To get an unbiased measure of mistakes, she sent a covert observer into the units. When she analyzed those data, the results flipped: psychologically safe teams reported more errors, but they actually made fewer errors. By freely admitting their mistakes, they were then able to learn what had caused them and eliminate them moving forward. In psychologically unsafe teams, people hid their mishaps to avoid penalties, which made it difficult for anyone to diagnose the root causes and prevent future problems. They kept repeating the same mistakes. Since then, research on psychological safety has flourished. When I was involved in a study at Google to identify the factors that distinguish teams with high performance and well-being, the most important differentiator wasn’t who was on the team or even how meaningful their work was. What mattered most was psychological safety. Over the past few years, psychological safety has become a buzzword in many workplaces. Although leaders might understand its significance, they often misunderstand exactly what it is and how to create it. Edmondson is quick to point out that psychological safety is not a matter of relaxing standards, making people comfortable, being nice and agreeable, or giving unconditional praise. It’s fostering a climate of respect, trust, and openness in which people can raise concerns and suggestions without fear of reprisal. It’s the foundation of a learning culture. In performance cultures, the emphasis on results often undermines psychological safety. When we see people get punished for failures and mistakes, we become worried about proving our competence and protecting our careers. We learn to engage in self-limiting behavior, biting our tongues rather than voicing questions and concerns. Sometimes that’s due to power distance: we’re afraid of challenging the big boss at the top. The pressure to conform to authority is real, and those who dare to deviate run the risk of backlash. In performance cultures, we also censor ourselves in the presence of experts who seem to know all the answers—especially if we lack confidence in our own expertise. A lack of psychological safety was a persistent problem at NASA. Before the Challenger launch, some engineers did raise red flags but were silenced by managers; others were ignored and ended up silencing themselves. After the Columbia launch, an engineer asked for clearer photographs to inspect the damage to the wing, but managers didn’t supply them. In a critical meeting to evaluate the condition of the shuttle after takeoff, the engineer didn’t speak up. About a month before that Columbia launch, Ellen Ochoa became the deputy director of flight crew operations. In 1993, Ellen had made history by becoming the first Latina in space. Now, the first flight she supported in a management role had ended in tragedy. After breaking the news to the space station crew and consoling the family members of the fallen astronauts, she was determined to figure out how she could personally help to prevent this kind of disaster from ever happening again. Ellen recognized that at NASA, the performance cu","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:29:1","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"SAFE AT HOME GATES When I first arrived at the Gates Foundation, people were whispering about the annual strategy reviews. It’s the time when program teams across the foundation meet with the cochairs—Bill and Melinda Gates—and the CEO to give progress reports on execution and collect feedback. Although the foundation employs some of the world’s leading experts in areas ranging from eradicating disease to promoting educational equity, these experts are often intimidated by Bill’s knowledge base, which seems impossibly broad and deep. What if he spots a fatal flaw in my work? Will it be the end of my career here? A few years ago, leaders at the Gates Foundation reached out to see if I could help them build psychological safety. They were worried that the pressure to present airtight analyses was discouraging people from taking risks. They often stuck to tried-and-true strategies that would make incremental progress rather than daring to undertake bold experiments that might make a bigger dent in some of the world’s most vexing problems. The existing evidence on creating psychological safety gave us some starting points. I knew that changing the culture of an entire organization is daunting, while changing the culture of a team is more feasible. It starts with modeling the values we want to promote, identifying and praising others who exemplify them, and building a coalition of colleagues who are committed to making the change. The standard advice for managers on building psychological safety is to model openness and inclusiveness. Ask for feedback on how you can improve, and people will feel safe to take risks. To test whether that recommendation would work, I launched an experiment with a doctoral student, Constantinos Coutifaris. In multiple companies, we randomly assigned some managers to ask their teams for constructive criticism. Over the following week, their teams reported higher psychological safety, but as we anticipated, it didn’t last. Some managers who asked for feedback didn’t like what they heard and got defensive. Others found the feedback useless or felt helpless to act on it, which discouraged them from continuing to seek feedback and their teams from continuing to offer it. Another group of managers took a different approach, one that had less immediate impact in the first week but led to sustainable gains in psychological safety a full year later. Instead of asking them to seek feedback, we had randomly assigned those managers to share their past experiences with receiving feedback and their future development goals. We advised them to tell their teams about a time when they benefited from constructive criticism and to identify the areas that they were working to improve now. By admitting some of their imperfections out loud, managers demonstrated that they could take it—and made a public commitment to remain open to feedback. They normalized vulnerability, making their teams more comfortable opening up about their own struggles. Their employees gave more useful feedback because they knew where their managers were working to grow. That motivated managers to create practices to keep the door open: they started holding “ask me anything” coffee chats, opening weekly one-on-one meetings by asking for constructive criticism, and setting up monthly team sessions where everyone shared their development goals and progress. Creating psychological safety can’t be an isolated episode or a task to check off on a to-do list. When discussing their weaknesses, many of the managers in our experiment felt awkward and anxious at first. Many of their team members were surprised by that vulnerability and unsure of how to respond. Some were skeptical: they thought their managers might be fishing for compliments or cherry-picking comments that made them look good. It was only over time—as managers repeatedly demonstrated humility and curiosity—that the dynamic changed. At the Gates Foundation, I wanted to go a step further.

The risk is that once we’ve declared a routine the best, it becomes frozen in time. We preach about its virtues and stop questioning its vices, no longer curious about where it’s imperfect and where it could improve. Organizational learning should be an ongoing activity, but best practices imply it has reached an endpoint. We might be better off looking for better practices. At NASA, although teams routinely debriefed after both training simulations and significant operational events, what sometimes stood in the way of exploring better practices was a performance culture that held people accountable for outcomes. Every time they delayed a scheduled launch, they faced widespread public criticism and threats to funding. Each time they celebrated a flight that made it into orbit, they were encouraging their engineers to focus on the fact that the launch resulted in a success rather than on the faulty processes that could jeopardize future launches. That left NASA rewarding luck and repeating problematic practices, failing to rethink what qualified as an acceptable risk. It wasn’t for a lack of ability. After all, these were rocket scientists. As Ellen Ochoa observes, “When you are dealing with people’s lives hanging in the balance, you rely on following the procedures you already have. This can be the best approach in a time-critical situation, but it’s problematic if it prevents a thorough assessment in the aftermath.” Focusing on results might be good for short-term performance, but it can be an obstacle to long-term learning. Sure enough, social scientists find that when people are held accountable only for whether the outcome was a success or failure, they are more likely to continue with ill-fated courses of action. Exclusively praising and rewarding results is dangerous because it breeds overconfidence in poor strategies, incentivizing people to keep doing things the way they’ve always done them. It isn’t until a high-stakes decision goes horribly wrong that people pause to reexamine their practices. We shouldn’t have to wait until a space shuttle explodes or an astronaut nearly drowns to determine whether a decision was successful. Along with outcome accountability, we can create process accountability by evaluating how carefully different options are considered as people make decisions. A bad decision process is based on shallow thinking. A good process is grounded in deep thinking and rethinking, enabling people to form and express independent opinions. Research shows that when we have to explain the procedures behind our decisions in real time, we think more critically and process the possibilities more thoroughly. Process accountability might sound like the opposite of psychological safety, but they’re actually independent. Amy Edmondson finds that when psychological safety exists without accountability, people tend to stay within their comfort zone, and when there’s accountability but not safety, people tend to stay silent in an anxiety zone. When we combine the two, we create a learning zone. People feel free to experiment—and to poke holes in one another’s experiments in service of making them better. They become a challenge network. One of the most effective steps toward process accountability that I’ve seen is at Amazon, where important decisions aren’t made based on simple PowerPoint presentations. They’re informed by a six-page memo that lays out a problem, the different approaches that have been considered in the past, and how the proposed solutions serve the customer. At the start of the meeting, to avoid groupthink, everyone reads the memo silently. This isn’t practical in every situation, but it’s paramount when choices are both consequential and irreversible. Long before the results of the decision are known, the quality of the process can be evaluated based on the rigor and creativity of the author","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:29:3","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"CHAPTER 11 ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:30:0","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"Escaping Tunnel Vision ","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:31:0","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"Reconsidering Our Best-Laid Career and Life Plans A malaise set in within a couple hours of my arriving. I thought getting a job might help. It turns out I have a lot of relatives in Hell, and, using connections, I became the assistant to a demon who pulls people’s teeth out. It wasn’t actually a job, more of an internship. But I was eager. And at first it was kind of interesting. After a while, though, you start asking yourself: Is this what I came to Hell for, to hand different kinds of pliers to a demon? —jack handey W**hat do you want to be when you grow up? As a kid, that was my least favorite question. I dreaded conversations with adults because they always asked it—and no matter how I replied, they never liked my answer. When I said I wanted to be a superhero, they laughed. My next goal was to make the NBA, but despite countless hours of shooting hoops on my driveway, I was cut from middle school basketball tryouts three years in a row. I was clearly aiming too high. In high school, I became obsessed with springboard diving and decided I wanted to become a diving coach. Adults scoffed at that plan: they told me I was aiming too low. In my first semester of college, I decided to major in psychology, but that didn’t open any doors—it just gave me a few to close. I knew I didn’t want to be a therapist (not patient enough) or a psychiatrist (too squeamish for med school). I was still aimless, and I envied people who had a clear career plan. From the time he was in kindergarten, my cousin Ryan knew exactly what he wanted to be when he grew up. Becoming a doctor wasn’t just the American dream—it was the family dream. Our great-grandparents emigrated from Russia and barely scraped by. Our grandmother was a secretary, and our grandfather worked in a factory, but it wasn’t enough to support five children, so he worked a second job delivering milk. Before his kids were teenagers, he had taught them to drive the milk truck so they could finish their 4:00 a.m. delivery cycle before the school day and workday started. When none of their children went on to med school (or milk delivery), my grandparents hoped our generation would bring the prestige of a Dr. Grant to the family. The first seven grandchildren didn’t become doctors. I was the eighth, and I worked multiple jobs to pay for college and to keep my options open. They were proud when I ended up getting my doctorate in psychology, but they still hoped for a real doctor. For the ninth grandchild, Ryan, who arrived four years after me, an M.D. was practically preordained. Ryan checked all the right boxes: along with being precocious, he had a strong work ethic. He set his sights on becoming a neurosurgeon. He was passionate about the potential to help people and ready to persist in the face of whatever obstacles would come into his path. When Ryan was looking at colleges, he came to visit me. As we started talking about majors, he expressed a flicker of doubt about the premed track and asked if he should study economics instead. There’s a term in psychology that captures Ryan’s personality: blirtatiousness. Yep, that’s an actual research concept, derived from the combination of blurting and flirting. When “blirters” meet people, their responses tend to be fast and effusive. They typically score high in extraversion and impulsiveness—and low in shyness and neuroticism. Ryan could push himself to study for long hours, but it drained him. Drawn to something more active and social, he toyed with the idea of squeezing in an economics major along with premed, but abandoned that idea when he got to college. Gotta stay on track. Ryan sailed through the premed curriculum and became a teaching assistant for undergrads while he was still an undergrad himself. When he showed up at exam review sessions and saw how stressed the students were, he refused to start covering the material until they stood up and danced. When he was accepted to an Ivy League medical school, he asked me if he should","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:32:0","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"GOING INTO FORECLOSURE When we dedicate ourselves to a plan and it isn’t going as we hoped, our first instinct isn’t usually to rethink it. Instead, we tend to double down and sink more resources in the plan. This pattern is called escalation of commitment. Evidence shows that entrepreneurs persist with failing strategies when they should pivot, NBA general managers and coaches keep investing in new contracts and more playing time for draft busts, and politicians continue sending soldiers to wars that didn’t need to be fought in the first place. Sunk costs are a factor, but the most important causes appear to be psychological rather than economic. Escalation of commitment happens because we’re rationalizing creatures, constantly searching for self-justifications for our prior beliefs as a way to soothe our egos, shield our images, and validate our past decisions. Escalation of commitment is a major factor in preventable failures. Ironically, it can be fueled by one of the most celebrated engines of success: grit. Grit is the combination of passion and perseverance, and research shows that it can play an important role in motivating us to accomplish long-term goals. When it comes to rethinking, though, grit may have a dark side. Experiments show that gritty people are more likely to overplay their hands in roulette and more willing to stay the course in tasks at which they’re failing and success is impossible. Researchers have even suggested that gritty mountaineers are more likely to die on expeditions, because they’re determined to do whatever it takes to reach the summit. There’s a fine line between heroic persistence and foolish stubbornness. Sometimes the best kind of grit is gritting our teeth and turning around. Ryan escalated his commitment to medical training for sixteen years. If he had been less tenacious, he might have changed tracks sooner. Early on, he had fallen victim to what psychologists call identity foreclosure—when we settle prematurely on a sense of self without enough due diligence, and close our minds to alternative selves. In career choices, identity foreclosure often begins when adults ask kids: what do you want to be when you grow up? Pondering that question can foster a fixed mindset about work and self. “I think it’s one of the most useless questions an adult can ask a child,” Michelle Obama writes. “What do you want to be when you grow up? As if growing up is finite. As if at some point you become something and that’s the end.”* Some kids dream too small. They foreclose on following in family footsteps and never really consider alternatives. You probably know some people who faced the opposite problem. They dreamed too big, becoming attached to a lofty vision that wasn’t realistic. Sometimes we lack the talent to pursue our callings professionally, leaving them unanswered; other times there’s little hope that our passions can pay the bills. “You can be anything you wanna be?!” the comedian Chris Rock quipped. “Tell the kids the truth. . . . You can be anything you’re good at . . . as long as they’re hiring.” Even if kids get excited about a career path that does prove realistic, what they thought was their dream job can turn out to be a nightmare. Kids might be better off learning about careers as actions to take rather than as identities to claim. When they see work as what they do rather than who they are, they become more open to exploring different possibilities. Although children are often fascinated by science from a young age, over the course of elementary school, they tend to lose interest and confidence in their potential to be scientists. Recent studies show that it’s possible to maintain their enthusiasm by introducing them to science differently. When second and third graders learned about “doing science” rather than “being scientists,” they were more excited about pursuing science. Becoming a scientist might seem out of reach, but the act of experimenting is something we can all try ou","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:32:1","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"TIME FOR A CHECKUP We foreclose on all kinds of life plans. Once you’ve committed to one, it becomes part of your identity, making it difficult to de-escalate. Declaring an English major because you love to read, only to discover that you don’t enjoy the process of writing. Deciding to start college during a pandemic, only to conclude later that you should have considered a gap year. Gotta stay on track. Ending a romantic relationship because you don’t want kids, only to realize years down the road that you might after all. Identity foreclosure can stop us from evolving. In a study of amateur musicians, those who had settled on music as a professional calling were more likely to ignore career advice from a trusted adviser over the course of the following seven years. They listened to their hearts and tuned out their mentors. In some ways, identity foreclosure is the opposite of an identity crisis: instead of accepting uncertainty about who we want to become, we develop compensatory conviction and plunge head over heels into a career path. I’ve noticed that the students who are the most certain about their career plans at twenty are often the ones with the deepest regrets by thirty. They haven’t done enough rethinking along the way.* Sometimes it’s because they’re thinking too much like politicians, eager to earn the approval of parents and peers. They become seduced by status, failing to see that no matter how much an accomplishment or affiliation impresses someone else, it’s still a poor choice if it depresses them. In other cases it’s because they’re stuck in preacher mode, and they’ve come to see a job as a sacred cause. And occasionally they pick careers in prosecutor mode, where they charge classmates with selling their souls to capitalism and hurl themselves into nonprofits in the hopes of saving the world. Sadly, they often know too little about the job—and too little about their evolving selves—to make a lifelong commitment. They get trapped in an overconfidence cycle, taking pride in pursuing a career identity and surrounding themselves with people who validate their conviction. By the time they discover it was the wrong fit, they feel it’s too late to think again. The stakes seem too high to walk away; the sacrifices of salary, status, skill, and time seem too great. For the record, I think it’s better to lose the past two years of progress than to waste the next twenty. In hindsight, identity foreclosure is a Band-Aid: it covers up an identity crisis, but fails to cure it. My advice to students is to take a cue from health-care professions. Just as they make appointments with the doctor and the dentist even when nothing is wrong, they should schedule checkups on their careers. I encourage them to put a reminder in their calendars to ask some key questions twice a year. When did you form the aspirations you’re currently pursuing, and how have you changed since then? Have you reached a learning plateau in your role or your workplace, and is it time to consider a pivot? Answering these career checkup questions is a way to periodically activate rethinking cycles. It helps students maintain humility about their ability to predict the future, contemplate doubts about their plans, and stay curious enough to discover new possibilities or reconsider previously discarded ones. I had one student, Marissa Shandell, who scored a coveted job at a prestigious consulting firm and planned on climbing up the ladder. She kept getting promoted early but found herself working around the clock. Instead of continuing to just grit and bear it, she and her husband had a career checkup conversation every six months, talking not just about the growth trajectory of their companies but also about the growth trajectory of their jobs. After being promoted to associate partner well ahead of schedule, Marissa realized she had reached a learning plateau (and a lifestyle plateau) and decided to pursue a doctorate in management.* Deciding to leave a c","date":"2022-09-03","objectID":"/en/think_again/:32:2","tags":["think"],"title":"Think Again","uri":"/en/think_again/"},{"categories":["think"],"content":"WHEN CHASING HAPPINESS CHASES IT AWAY When we think about how to plan our lives, there are few things that take priority over happiness. The kingdom of Bhutan has a Gross National Happiness index. In the United States, the pursuit of happiness is so prized that it’s one of the three unalienable rights in our Declaration of Independence. If we’re not careful, though, the pursuit of happiness can become a recipe for misery. Psychologists find that the more people value happiness, the less happy they often become with their lives. It’s true for people who naturally care about happiness and for people who are randomly assigned to reflect on why happiness matters. There’s even evidence that placing a great deal of importance on happiness is a risk factor for depression. Why? One possibility is that when we’re searching for happiness, we get too busy evaluating life to actually experience it. Instead of savoring our moments of joy, we ruminate about why our lives aren’t more joyful. A second likely culprit is that we spend too much time striving for peak happiness, overlooking the fact that happiness depends more on the frequency of positive emotions than their intensity. A third potential factor is that when we hunt for happiness, we overemphasize pleasure at the expense of purpose. This theory is consistent with data suggesting that meaning is healthier than happiness, and that people who look for purpose in their work are more successful in pursuing their passions—and less likely to quit their jobs—than those who look for joy. While enjoyment waxes and wanes, meaning tends to last. A fourth explanation is that Western conceptions of happiness as an individual state leave us feeling lonely. In more collectivistic Eastern cultures, that pattern is reversed: pursuing happiness predicts higher well-being, because people prioritize social engagement over independent activities. Last fall a student stopped by my office hours for some advice. She explained that when she chose Wharton, she had focused too much on getting into the best school and too little on finding the best fit. She wished she had picked a college with a more carefree culture and a stronger sense of community. Now that she was clear on her values, she was considering a transfer to a school that would make her happier. A few weeks later she told me that a moment in class had helped her rethink her plan. It wasn’t the research on happiness that we discussed, the values survey she took, or the decision-making activity we did. It was a comedy sketch I showed from Saturday Night Live. The scene stars Adam Sandler as a tour guide. In a mock commercial advertising his company’s Italian tours, he mentions that customer reviews sometimes express disappointment. He takes the opportunity to remind customers about what a vacation can and can’t do for them: There’s a lot a vacation can do: help you unwind, see some different-looking squirrels, but it cannot fix deeper issues, like how you behave in group settings. We can take you on a hike. We cannot turn you into someone who likes hiking. Remember, you’re still gonna be you on vacation. If you are sad where you are, and then you get on a plane to Italy, the you in Italy will be the same sad you from before, just in a new place. © Saturday Night Live/NBC When we pursue happiness, we often start by changing our surroundings. We expect to find bliss in a warmer climate or a friendlier dorm, but any joy that those choices bring about is typically temporary. In a series of studies, students who changed their environments by adjusting their living arrangements or course schedules quickly returned to their baseline levels of happiness. As Ernest Hemingway wrote, “You can’t get away from yourself by moving from one place to another.” Meanwhile, students who changed their actions by joining a new club, adjusting their study habits, or starting a new project experienced lasting gains in happiness.

Still, when it comes to careers, instead of searching for the job where we’ll be happiest, we might be better off pursuing the job where we expect to learn and contribute the most. Psychologists find that passions are often developed, not discovered. In a study of entrepreneurs, the more effort they put into their startups, the more their enthusiasm about their businesses climbed each week. Their passion grew as they gained momentum and mastery. Interest doesn’t always lead to effort and skill; sometimes it follows them. By investing in learning and problem solving, we can develop our passions—and build the skills necessary to do the work and lead the lives we find worthwhile. As we get older, we become more focused on searching for meaning—and we’re most likely to find it in actions that benefit others. My favorite test of meaningful work is to ask: if this job didn’t exist, how much worse off would people be? It’s near midlife that this question often begins to loom large. At around this time, in both work and life, we feel we have more to give (and less to lose), and we’re especially keen to share our knowledge and skills with the next generation. When my students talk about the evolution of self-esteem in their careers, the progression often goes something like this: Phase 1: I’m not important Phase 2: I’m important Phase 3: I want to contribute to something important I’ve noticed that the sooner they get to phase 3, the more impact they have and the more happiness they experience. It’s left me thinking about happiness less as a goal and more as a by-product of mastery and meaning. “Those only are happy,” philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote, “who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness; on the happiness of others, on the improvement of mankind, even on some art or pursuit, followed not as a means, but as itself an ideal end. Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness by the way.” Careers, relationships, and communities are examples of what scientists call open systems—they’re constantly in flux because they’re not closed off from the environments around them. We know that open systems are governed by at least two key principles: there are always multiple paths to the same end (equifinality), and the same starting point can be a path to many different ends (multifinality). We should be careful to avoid getting too attached to a particular route or even a particular destination. There isn’t one definition of success or one track to happiness. My cousin Ryan finally wound up rethinking his career arc. Five years into his neurosurgery residency, he did his own version of a career checkup and decided to scratch his entrepreneurial itch. He cofounded a fast-growing, venture-backed startup called Nomad Health, which creates a marketplace to match clinicians with medical facilities. He also advised several medical device startups, filed medical device patents, and is now working on multiple startups to improve health care. Looking back, he still regrets that he foreclosed so early on an identity as a neurosurgeon and escalated his commitment to that career. At work and in life, the best we can do is plan for what we want to learn and contribute over the next year or two, and stay open to what might come next. To adapt an analogy from E. L. Doctorow, writing out a plan for your life “is like driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.” we don’t have to upend our entire paths to rethink some of our plans.

INDIVIDUAL RETHINKING A. Develop the Habit of Thinking Again \\1. Think like a scientist. When you start forming an opinion, resist the temptation to preach, prosecute, or politick. Treat your emerging view as a hunch or a hypothesis and test it with data. Like the entrepreneurs who learned to approach their business strategies as experiments, you’ll maintain the agility to pivot. \\2. Define your identity in terms of values, not opinions. It’s easier to avoid getting stuck to your past beliefs if you don’t become attached to them as part of your present self-concept. See yourself as someone who values curiosity, learning, mental flexibility, and searching for knowledge. As you form opinions, keep a list of factors that would change your mind. \\3. Seek out information that goes against your views. You can fight confirmation bias, burst filter bubbles, and escape echo chambers by actively engaging with ideas that challenge your assumptions. An easy place to start is to follow people who make you think—even if you usually disagree with what they think. B. Calibrate Your Confidence \\4. Beware of getting stranded at the summit of Mount Stupid. Don’t confuse confidence with competence. The Dunning-Kruger effect is a good reminder that the better you think you are, the greater the risk that you’re overestimating yourself—and the greater the odds that you’ll stop improving. To prevent overconfidence in your knowledge, reflect on how well you can explain a given subject. \\5. Harness the benefits of doubt. When you find yourself doubting your ability, reframe the situation as an opportunity for growth. You can have confidence in your capacity to learn while questioning your current solution to a problem. Knowing what you don’t know is often the first step toward developing expertise. \\6. Embrace the joy of being wrong. When you find out you’ve made a mistake, take it as a sign that you’ve just discovered something new. Don’t be afraid to laugh at yourself. It helps you focus less on proving yourself—and more on improving yourself. C. Invite Others to Question Your Thinking \\7. Learn something new from each person you meet. Everyone knows more than you about something. Ask people what they’ve been rethinking lately, or start a conversation about times you’ve changed your mind in the past year. \\8. Build a challenge network, not just a support network. It’s helpful to have cheerleaders encouraging you, but you also need critics to challenge you. Who are your most thoughtful critics? Once you’ve identified them, invite them to question your thinking. To make sure they know you’re open to dissenting views, tell them why you respect their pushback—and where they usually add the most value. \\9. Don’t shy away from constructive conflict. Disagreements don’t have to be disagreeable. Although relationship conflict is usually counterproductive, task conflict can help you think again. Try framing disagreement as a debate: people are more likely to approach it intellectually and less likely to take it personally.

Ask Better Questions \\10. Practice the art of persuasive listening. When we’re trying to open other people’s minds, we can frequently accomplish more by listening than by talking. How can you show an interest in helping people crystallize their own views and uncover their own reasons for change? A good way to start is to increase your question-to-statement ratio. \\11. Question how rather than why. When people describe why they hold extreme views, they often intensify their commitment and double down. When they try to explain how they would make their views a reality, they often realize the limits of their understanding and start to temper some of their opinions. \\12. Ask “What evidence would change your mind?” You can’t bully someone into agreeing with you. It’s often more effective to inquire about what would open their minds, and then see if you can convince them on their own terms. \\13. Ask how people originally formed an opinion. Many of our opinions, like our stereotypes, are arbitrary; we’ve developed them without rigorous data or deep reflection. To help people reevaluate, prompt them to consider how they’d believe different things if they’d been born at a different time or in a different place. B. Approach Disagreements as Dances, Not Battles \\14. Acknowledge common ground. A debate is like a dance, not a war. Admitting points of convergence doesn’t make you weaker—it shows that you’re willing to negotiate about what’s true, and it motivates the other side to consider your point of view. \\15. Remember that less is often more. If you pile on too many different reasons to support your case, it can make your audiences defensive—and cause them to reject your entire argument based on its least compelling points. Instead of diluting your argument, lead with a few of your strongest points. \\16. Reinforce freedom of choice. Sometimes people resist not because they’re dismissing the argument but because they’re rejecting the feeling of their behavior being controlled. It helps to respect their autonomy by reminding them that it’s up to them to choose what they believe. \\17. Have a conversation about the conversation. If emotions are running hot, try redirecting the discussion to the process. Like the expert negotiators who comment on their feelings and test their understanding of the other side’s feelings, you can sometimes make progress by expressing your disappointment or frustration and asking people if they share it.

Have More Nuanced Conversations \\18. Complexify contentious topics. There are more than two sides to every story. Instead of treating polarizing issues like two sides of a coin, look at them through the many lenses of a prism. Seeing the shades of gray can make us more open. \\19. Don’t shy away from caveats and contingencies. Acknowledging competing claims and conflicting results doesn’t sacrifice interest or credibility. It’s an effective way to engage audiences while encouraging them to stay curious. \\20. Expand your emotional range. You don’t have to eliminate frustration or even indignation to have a productive conversation. You just need to mix in a broader set of emotions along with them—you might try showing some curiosity or even admitting confusion or ambivalence. B. Teach Kids to Think Again \\21. Have a weekly myth-busting discussion at dinner. It’s easier to debunk false beliefs at an early age, and it’s a great way to teach kids to become comfortable with rethinking. Pick a different topic each week—one day it might be dinosaurs, the next it could be outer space—and rotate responsibility around the family for bringing a myth for discussion. \\22. Invite kids to do multiple drafts and seek feedback from others. Creating different versions of a drawing or a story can encourage kids to learn the value of revising their ideas. Getting input from others can also help them to continue evolving their standards. They might learn to embrace confusion—and to stop expecting perfection on the first try. \\23. Stop asking kids what they want to be when they grow up. They don’t have to define themselves in terms of a career. A single identity can close the door to alternatives. Instead of trying to narrow their options, help them broaden their possibilities. They don’t have to be one thing—they can do many things. C. Create Learning Organizations \\24. Abandon best practices. Best practices suggest that the ideal routines are already in place. If we want people to keep rethinking the way they work, we might be better off adopting process accountability and continually striving for better practices. \\25. Establish psychological safety. In learning cultures, people feel confident that they can question and challenge the status quo without being punished. Psychological safety often starts with leaders role-modeling humility. \\26. Keep a rethinking scorecard. Don’t evaluate decisions based only on the results; track how thoroughly different options are considered in the process. A bad process with a good outcome is luck. A good process with a bad outcome might be a smart experiment. D. Stay Open to Rethinking Your Future \\27. Throw out the ten-year plan. What interested you last year might bore you this year—and what confused you yesterday might become exciting tomorrow. Passions are developed, not just discovered. Planning just one step ahead can keep you open to rethinking. \\28. Rethink your actions, not just your surroundings. Chasing happiness can chase it away. Trading one set of circumstances for another isn’t always enough. Joy can wax and wane, but meaning is more likely to last. Building a sense of purpose often starts with taking actions to enhance your learning or your contribution to others. \\29. Schedule a life checkup. It’s easy to get caught in escalation of commitment to an unfulfilling path. Just as you schedule health checkups with your doctor, it’s worth having a life checkup on your calendar once or twice a year. It’s a way to assess how much you’re learning, how your beliefs and goals are evolving, and whether your next steps warrant some rethinking. \\30. Make time to think again. When I looked at my calendar, I noticed that it was mostly full of doing. I set a goal of spending an hour a day thinking and learning. Now I’ve decided to go further: I’m scheduling a weekly time for rethinking and unlearning.

Olin Center for Inquiry into the Theory and Practice of Democracy at the University of Chicago. Both have been long-time teachers and friends from whom I have learned an enormous amount over the years—starting with, but by no means limited to, political philosophy. That original lecture became a well-known article due, in no small measure, to the efforts of Owen Harries, editor of the journal The National Interest, and to the work of that journal’s small staff. Erwin Glikes of the Free Press and Andrew Franklin of Hamish Hamilton provided crucial encouragement and advice in moving from the article to the book, and in the editing of the final manuscript. The present volume has profited enormously from conversations and readings by any number of friends and colleagues. Most important of these has been Abram Shulsky, who will find many of his ideas and insights recorded here. I would like to pay special thanks to Irving Kristol, David Epstein, Alvin Bernstein, Henry Higuera, Yoshihisa Komori, Yoshio Fukuyama, and George Holmgren, all of whom took the time to read and comment on the manuscript. In addition, I would like to thank the many people— some of them known to me and many others not—who commented usefully on various aspects of the present thesis as it was presented in a variety of seminars and lectures in this country and abroad. James Thomson, president of the RAND Corporation, was kind enough to provide me office space while drafting this book. Gary and Linda Armstrong took time out from writing their dissertations to help me in the collection of research materials, and provided valuable advice on a number of topics in the course of writing. Rosalie Fonoroff helped in the proofreading. In lieu of conventional thanks to a typist for helping to prepare the manuscript, I should perhaps acknowledge the work of the designers of the Intel 80386 microprocessor. Last but most important, it was my wife, Laura, who encouraged me to write both the original article and the present book, and who has stood by me through all of the subsequent criticism and controversy. She has been a careful reader of the manuscript, and has contributed in innumerable ways to its final form and content. My daughter Julia and my son David, the latter of whom chose to be born as the book was being written, helped too, simply by being there. BY WAY OF AN INTRODUCTION The distant origins of the present volume lie in an article entitled “The End of History?” which I wrote for the journal The National Interest in the summer of 1989. In it, I argued that a remarkable consensus concerning the legitimacy of liberal democracy as a system of government had emerged throughout the world over the past few years, as it conquered rival ideologies like hereditary monarchy, fascism, and most recently communism. More than that, however, I argued that liberal democracy may constitute the “end point of mankind’s ideological evolution” and the “final form of human government,” and as such constituted the “end of history.” That is, while earlier forms of government were characterized by grave defects and irrationalities that led to their eventual collapse, liberal democracy was arguably free from such fundamental internal contradictions. This was not to say that today’s stable democracies, like the United States, France, or Switzerland, were not without injustice or serious social problems. But these problems were ones of incomplete implementation of the twin principles of liberty and equality on which modern democracy is founded, rather than of flaws in the principles themselves. While some presentday countries might fail to achieve stable liberal democracy, ","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/the_end_of_history_and_the_last_man/:0:0","tags":["history"],"title":"The End of History and the Last Man","uri":"/en/the_end_of_history_and_the_last_man/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"LORD PRESIDENT OF HIS MAJESTY’S MOST HONOURABLE PRIVY COUNCIL; AND LORD LIEUTENANT OF THE COUNTY OF WILTS, AND OF SOUTH WALES.

It is not that I think any name, how great soever, set at the beginning of a book, will be able to cover the faults that are to be found in it. Things in print must stand and fall by their own worth, or the reader’s fancy. But there being nothing more to be desired for truth than a fair unprejudiced hearing, nobody is more likely to procure me that than your lordship, who are allowed to have got so intimate an acquaintance with her, in her more retired recesses. Your lordship is known to have so far advanced your speculations in the most abstract and general knowledge of things, beyond the ordinary reach or common methods, that your allowance and approbation of the design of this Treatise will at least preserve it from being condemned without reading, and will prevail to have those parts a little weighed, which might otherwise perhaps be thought to deserve no consideration, for being somewhat out of the common road. The imputation of Novelty is a terrible charge amongst those who judge of men’s heads, as they do of their perukes, by the fashion, and can allow none to be right but the received doctrines. Truth scarce ever yet carried it by vote anywhere at its first appearance: new opinions are always suspected, and usually opposed, without any other reason but because they are not already common. But truth, like gold, is not the less so for being newly brought out of the mine. It is trial and examination must give it price, and not any antique fashion; and though it be not yet current by the public stamp, yet it may, for all that, be as old as nature, and is certainly not the less genuine. Your lordship can give great and convincing instances of this, whenever you please to oblige the public with some of those large and comprehensive discoveries you have made of truths hitherto unknown, unless to some few, from whom your lordship has been pleased not wholly to conceal them. This alone were a sufficient reason, were there no other, why I should dedicate this Essay to your lordship; and its having some little correspondence with some parts of that nobler and vast system of the sciences your lordship has made so new, exact, and instructive a draught of, I think it glory enough, if your lordship permit me to boast, that here and there I have fallen into some thoughts not wholly different from yours. If your lordship think fit that, by your encouragement, this should appear in the world, I hope it may be a reason, some time or other, to lead your lordship further; and you will allow me to say, that you here give the world an earnest of something that, if they can bear with this, will be truly worth their expectation. This, my lord, shows what a present I here make to your lordship; just such as the poor man does to his rich and great neighbour, by whom the basket of flowers or fruit is not ill taken, though he has more plenty of his own growth, and in much greater perfection. Worthless things receive a value when they are made the offerings of respect, esteem, and gratitude: these you have given me so mighty and peculiar reasons to have, in the highest degree, for your lordship, that if they can add a price to what they go along with, proportionable to their own greatness, I can with confidence brag, I here make your lordship the richest present you ever received. This I am sure, I am under the greatest obligations to seek all occasions to acknowledge a long train of favours I have received from your lordship; favours, though great and important in themselves, yet made much more so by the forwardness, concern, and kindness, and other obliging circumstances, that never failed to accompany them. To all this you are pleased to add that which gives yet more weight and relish to all the rest: you vouch","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:0:1","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"MY LORD, Your Lordship’s most humble and most obedient servant, ","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:0:2","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"JOHN LOCKE 2 Dorset Court, 24th of May, 1689 ","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:0:3","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"THE EPISTLE TO THE READER ","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:1:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"READER, I have put into thy hands what has been the diversion of some of my idle and heavy hours. If it has the good luck to prove so of any of thine, and thou hast but half so much pleasure in reading as I had in writing it, thou wilt as little think thy money, as I do my pains, ill bestowed. Mistake not this for a commendation of my work; nor conclude, because I was pleased with the doing of it, that therefore I am fondly taken with it now it is done. He that hawks at larks and sparrows has no less sport, though a much less considerable quarry, than he that flies at nobler game: and he is little acquainted with the subject of this treatise—the UNDERSTANDING—who does not know that, as it is the most elevated faculty of the soul, so it is employed with a greater and more constant delight than any of the other. Its searches after truth are a sort of hawking and hunting, wherein the very pursuit makes a great part of the pleasure. Every step the mind takes in its progress towards Knowledge makes some discovery, which is not only new, but the best too, for the time at least. For the understanding, like the eye, judging of objects only by its own sight, cannot but be pleased with what it discovers, having less regret for what has escaped it, because it is unknown. Thus he who has raised himself above the alms-basket, and, not content to live lazily on scraps of begged opinions, sets his own thoughts on work, to find and follow truth, will (whatever he lights on) not miss the hunter’s satisfaction; every moment of his pursuit will reward his pains with some delight; and he will have reason to think his time not ill spent, even when he cannot much boast of any great acquisition. This, Reader, is the entertainment of those who let loose their own thoughts, and follow them in writing; which thou oughtest not to envy them, since they afford thee an opportunity of the like diversion, if thou wilt make use of thy own thoughts in reading. It is to them, if they are thy own, that I refer myself: but if they are taken upon trust from others, it is no great matter what they are; they are not following truth, but some meaner consideration; and it is not worth while to be concerned what he says or thinks, who says or thinks only as he is directed by another. If thou judgest for thyself I know thou wilt judge candidly, and then I shall not be harmed or offended, whatever be thy censure. For though it be certain that there is nothing in this Treatise of the truth whereof I am not fully persuaded, yet I consider myself as liable to mistakes as I can think thee, and know that this book must stand or fall with thee, not by any opinion I have of it, but thy own. If thou findest little in it new or instructive to thee, thou art not to blame me for it. It was not meant for those that had already mastered this subject, and made a thorough acquaintance with their own understandings; but for my own information, and the satisfaction of a few friends, who acknowledged themselves not to have sufficiently considered it. Were it fit to trouble thee with the history of this Essay, I should tell thee, that five or six friends meeting at my chamber, and discoursing on a subject very remote from this, found themselves quickly at a stand, by the difficulties that rose on every side. After we had awhile puzzled ourselves, without coming any nearer a resolution of those doubts which perplexed us, it came into my thoughts that we took a wrong course; and that before we set ourselves upon inquiries of that nature, it was necessary to examine our own abilities, and see what OBJECTS our understandings were, or were not, fitted to deal with. This I proposed to the company, who all readily assented; and thereupon it was agreed that this should be our first inquiry. Some hasty and undigested thoughts, on a subject I had never before considered, which I set down against our next meeting, gave the first entrance into this Discourse; which having been thus begun by chance, wa","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:1:1","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"ESSAY CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING.

An Inquiry into the Understanding pleasant and useful. Since it is the UNDERSTANDING that sets man above the rest of sensible beings, and gives him all the advantage and dominion which he has over them; it is certainly a subject, even for its nobleness, worth our labour to inquire into. The understanding, like the eye, whilst it makes us see and perceive all other things, takes no notice of itself; and it requires and art and pains to set it at a distance and make it its own object. But whatever be the difficulties that lie in the way of this inquiry; whatever it be that keeps us so much in the dark to ourselves; sure I am that all the light we can let in upon our minds, all the acquaintance we can make with our own understandings, will not only be very pleasant, but bring us great advantage, in directing our thoughts in the search of other things. \\2. Design. This, therefore, being my purpose—to inquire into the original, certainty, and extent of HUMAN KNOWLEDGE, together with the grounds and degrees of BELIEF, OPINION, and ASSENT;—I shall not at present meddle with the physical consideration of the mind; or trouble myself to examine wherein its essence consists; or by what motions of our spirits or alterations of our bodies we come to have any SENSATION by our organs, or any IDEAS in our understandings; and whether those ideas do in their formation, any or all of them, depend on matter or not. These are speculations which, however curious and entertaining, I shall decline, as lying out of my way in the design I am now upon. It shall suffice to my present purpose, to consider the discerning faculties of a man, as they are employed about the objects which they have to do with. And I shall imagine I have not wholly misemployed myself in the thoughts I shall have on this occasion, if, in this historical, plain method, I can give any account of the ways whereby our understandings come to attain those notions of things we have; and can set down any measures of the certainty of our knowledge; or the grounds of those persuasions which are to be found amongst men, so various, different, and wholly contradictory; and yet asserted somewhere or other with such assurance and confidence, that he that shall take a view of the opinions of mankind, observe their opposition, and at the same time consider the fondness and devotion wherewith they are embraced, the resolution and eagerness wherewith they are maintained, may perhaps have reason to suspect, that either there is no such thing as truth at all, or that mankind hath no sufficient means to attain a certain knowledge of it. \\3. Method. It is therefore worth while to search out the bounds between opinion and knowledge; and examine by what measures, in things whereof we have no certain knowledge, we ought to regulate our assent and moderate our persuasion. In order whereunto I shall pursue this following method:— First, I shall inquire into the original of those ideas, notions, or whatever else you please to call them, which a man observes, and is conscious to himself he has in his mind; and the ways whereby the understanding comes to be furnished with them. Secondly, I shall endeavour to show what knowledge the understanding hath by those ideas; and the certainty, evidence, and extent of it. Thirdly, I shall make some inquiry into the nature and grounds of FAITH or OPINION: whereby I mean that assent which we give to any proposition as true, of whose truth yet we have no certain knowledge. And here we shall have occasion to examine the reasons and degrees of ASSENT. \\4. Useful to know the Extent of our Comprehension. If by this inquiry into the nature of the understanding, I can discover the powers thereof; how far they reach; to what things they are in any degree proportionate; and where they fail us, I suppose it may be of use to prevail with the busy mind of man to be more cautious in meddling with things exceeding its comprehension; to stop when it is at the utmost ","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:3:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"BOOK I—NEITHER PRINCIPLES NOR IDEAS ARE INNATE ","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:4:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER I.—NO INNATE SPECULATIVE PRINCIPLES. \\1. The way shown how we come by any Knowledge, sufficient to prove it not innate. It is an established opinion amongst some men, that there are in the understanding certain INNATE PRINCIPLES; some primary notions, KOIVAI EVVOIAI, characters, as it were stamped upon the mind of man; which the soul receives in its very first being, and brings into the world with it. It would be sufficient to convince unprejudiced readers of the falseness of this supposition, if I should only show (as I hope I shall in the following parts of this Discourse) how men, barely by the use of their natural faculties may attain to all the knowledge they have, without the help of any innate impressions; and may arrive at certainty, without any such original notions or principles. For I imagine any one will easily grant that it would be impertinent to suppose the ideas of colours innate in a creature to whom God hath given sight, and a power to receive them by the eyes from external objects: and no less unreasonable would it be to attribute several truths to the impressions of nature, and innate characters, when we may observe in ourselves faculties fit to attain as easy and certain knowledge of them as if they were originally imprinted on the mind. But because a man is not permitted without censure to follow his own thoughts in the search of truth, when they lead him ever so little out of the common road, I shall set down the reasons that made me doubt of the truth of that opinion, as an excuse for my mistake, if I be in one; which I leave to be considered by those who, with me, dispose themselves to embrace truth wherever they find it. \\2. General Assent the great Argument. There is nothing more commonly taken for granted than that there are certain PRINCIPLES, both SPECULATIVE and PRACTICAL, (for they speak of both), universally agreed upon by all mankind: which therefore, they argue, must needs be the constant impressions which the souls of men receive in their first beings, and which they bring into the world with them, as necessarily and really as they do any of their inherent faculties. \\3. Universal Consent proves nothing innate. This argument, drawn from universal consent, has this misfortune in it, that if it were true in matter of fact, that there were certain truths wherein all mankind agreed, it would not prove them innate, if there can be any other way shown how men may come to that universal agreement, in the things they do consent in, which I presume may be done. \\4. “What is is,” and “It is possible for the same Thing to be and not to be,” not universally assented to. But, which is worse, this argument of universal consent, which is made use of to prove innate principles, seems to me a demonstration that there are none such: because there are none to which all mankind give an universal assent. I shall begin with the speculative, and instance in those magnified principles of demonstration, “Whatsoever is, is,” and “It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be”; which, of all others, I think have the most allowed title to innate. These have so settled a reputation of maxims universally received, that it will no doubt be thought strange if any one should seem to question it. But yet I take liberty to say, that these propositions are so far from having an universal assent, that there are a great part of mankind to whom they are not so much as known. \\5. Not on Mind naturally imprinted, because not known to Children, Idiots, \u0026c. For, first, it is evident, that all children and idiots have not the least apprehension or thought of them. And the want of that is enough to destroy that universal assent which must needs be the necessary concomitant of all innate truths: it seeming to me near a contradiction to say, that there are truths imprinted on the soul, which it perceives or understands not: imprinting, if it signify anything, being nothing else but the making certain truths to be percei","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:5:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER II.—NO INNATE PRACTICAL PRINCIPLES \\1. No moral Principles so clear and so generally received as the forementioned speculative Maxims. If those speculative Maxims, whereof we discoursed in the foregoing chapter, have not an actual universal assent from all mankind, as we there proved, it is much more visible concerning PRACTICAL Principles, that they come short of an universal reception: and I think it will be hard to instance any one moral rule which can pretend to so general and ready an assent as, “What is, is”; or to be so manifest a truth as this, that “It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be.” Whereby it is evident that they are further removed from a title to be innate; and the doubt of their being native impressions on the mind is stronger against those moral principles than the other. Not that it brings their truth at all in question. They are equally true, though not equally evident. Those speculative maxims carry their own evidence with them: but moral principles require reasoning and discourse, and some exercise of the mind, to discover the certainty of their truth. They lie not open as natural characters engraved on the mind; which, if any such were, they must needs be visible by themselves, and by their own light be certain and known to everybody. But this is no derogation to their truth and certainty; no more than it is to the truth or certainty of the three angles of a triangle being equal to two right ones because it is not so evident as “the whole is bigger than a part,” nor so apt to be assented to at first hearing. It may suffice that these moral rules are capable of demonstration: and therefore it is our own faults if we come not to a certain knowledge of them. But the ignorance wherein many men are of them, and the slowness of assent wherewith others receive them, are manifest proofs that they are not innate, and such as offer themselves to their view without searching. \\2. Faith and Justice not owned as Principles by all Men. Whether there be any such moral principles, wherein all men do agree, I appeal to any who have been but moderately conversant in the history of mankind, and looked abroad beyond the smoke of their own chimneys. Where is that practical truth that is universally received, without doubt or question, as it must be if innate? JUSTICE, and keeping of contracts, is that which most men seem to agree in. This is a principle which is thought to extend itself to the dens of thieves, and the confederacies of the greatest villains; and they who have gone furthest towards the putting off of humanity itself, keep faith and rules of justice one with another. I grant that outlaws themselves do this one amongst another: but it is without receiving these as the innate laws of nature. They practise them as rules of convenience within their own communities: but it is impossible to conceive that he embraces justice as a practical principle who acts fairly with his fellow-highwayman, and at the same time plunders or kills the next honest man he meets with. Justice and truth are the common ties of society; and therefore even outlaws and robbers, who break with all the world besides, must keep faith and rules of equity amongst themselves; or else they cannot hold together. But will any one say, that those that live by fraud or rapine have innate principles of truth and justice which they allow and assent to? \\3. Objection: though Men deny them in their Practice, yet they admit them in their Thoughts answered. Perhaps it will be urged, that the tacit assent of their minds agrees to what their practice contradicts. I answer, first, I have always thought the actions of men the best interpreters of their thoughts. But, since it is certain that most men’s practices, and some men’s open professions, have either questioned or denied these principles, it is impossible to establish an universal consent, (though we should look for it only amongst grown men,) without which it is impossible to c","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:6:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER III.—OTHER CONSIDERATIONS CONCERNING INNATE PRINCIPLES, BOTH SPECULATIVE AND PRACTICAL. \\1. Principles not innate, unless their Ideas be innate Had those who would persuade us that there are innate principles not taken them together in gross, but considered separately the parts out of which those propositions are made, they would not, perhaps, have been so forward to believe they were innate. Since, if the IDEAS which made up those truths were not, it was impossible that the PROPOSITIONS made up of them should be innate, or our knowledge of them be born with us. For, if the ideas be not innate, there was a time when the mind was without those principles; and then they will not be innate, but be derived from some other original. For, where the ideas themselves are not, there can be no knowledge, no assent, no mental or verbal propositions about them. \\2. Ideas, especially those belonging to Principles, not born with children If we will attentively consider new-born children, we shall have little reason to think that they bring many ideas into the world with them. For, bating perhaps some faint ideas of hunger, and thirst, and warmth, and some pains, which they may have felt in the womb, there is not the least appearance of any settled ideas at all in them; especially of IDEAS ANSWERING THE TERMS WHICH MAKE UP THOSE UNIVERSAL PROPOSITIONS THAT ARE ESTEEMED INNATE PRINCIPLES. One may perceive how, by degrees, afterwards, ideas come into their minds; and that they get no more, nor other, than what experience, and the observation of things that come in their way, furnish them with; which might be enough to satisfy us that they are not original characters stamped on the mind. \\3. Impossibility and Identity not innate ideas “It is impossible for the same thing to be, and not to be,” is certainly (if there be any such) an innate PRINCIPLE. But can any one think, or will any one say, that “impossibility” and “identity” are two innate IDEAS? Are they such as all mankind have, and bring into the world with them? And are they those which are the first in children, and antecedent to all acquired ones? If they are innate, they must needs be so. Hath a child an idea of impossibility and identity, before it has of white or black, sweet or bitter? And is it from the knowledge of this principle that it concludes, that wormwood rubbed on the nipple hath not the same taste that it used to receive from thence? Is it the actual knowledge of IMPOSSIBILE EST IDEM ESSE, ET NON ESSE, that makes a child distinguish between its mother and a stranger; or that makes it fond of the one and flee the other? Or does the mind regulate itself and its assent by ideas that it never yet had? Or the understanding draw conclusions from principles which it never yet knew or understood? The names IMPOSSIBILITY and IDENTITY stand for two ideas, so far from being innate, or born with us, that I think it requires great care and attention to form them right in our understandings. They are so far from being brought into the world with us, so remote from the thoughts of infancy and childhood, that I believe, upon examination it will be found that many grown men want them. \\4. Identity, an Idea not innate. If IDENTITY (to instance that alone) be a native impression, and consequently so clear and obvious to us that we must needs know it even from our cradles, I would gladly be resolved by any one of seven, or seventy years old, whether a man, being a creature consisting of soul and body, be the same man when his body is changed? Whether Euphorbus and Pythagoras, having had the same soul, were the same men, though they lived several ages asunder? Nay, whether the cock too, which had the same soul, were not the same, with both of them? Whereby, perhaps, it will appear that our idea of SAMENESS is not so settled and clear as to deserve to be thought innate in us. For if those innate ideas are not clear and distinct, so as to be universally known and naturally agreed on, t","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:7:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"BOOK II—OF IDEAS ","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:8:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER I.—OF IDEAS IN GENERAL, AND THEIR ORIGINAL. \\1. Idea is the Object of Thinking. Every man being conscious to himself that he thinks; and that which his mind is applied about whilst thinking being the IDEAS that are there, it is past doubt that men have in their minds several ideas,—such as are those expressed by the words whiteness, hardness, sweetness, thinking, motion, man, elephant, army, drunkenness, and others: it is in the first place then to be inquired, HOW HE COMES BY THEM? I know it is a received doctrine, that men have native ideas, and original characters, stamped upon their minds in their very first being. This opinion I have at large examined already; and, I suppose what I have said in the foregoing Book will be much more easily admitted, when I have shown whence the understanding may get all the ideas it has; and by what ways and degrees they may come into the mind;—for which I shall appeal to every one’s own observation and experience. \\2. All Ideas come from Sensation or Reflection. Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas:—How comes it to be furnished? Whence comes it by that vast store which the busy and boundless fancy of man has painted on it with an almost endless variety? Whence has it all the MATERIALS of reason and knowledge? To this I answer, in one word, from EXPERIENCE. In that all our knowledge is founded; and from that it ultimately derives itself. Our observation employed either, about external sensible objects, or about the internal operations of our minds perceived and reflected on by ourselves, is that which supplies our understandings with all the MATERIALS of thinking. These two are the fountains of knowledge, from whence all the ideas we have, or can naturally have, do spring. \\3. The Objects of Sensation one Source of Ideas First, our Senses, conversant about particular sensible objects, do convey into the mind several distinct perceptions of things, according to those various ways wherein those objects do affect them. And thus we come by those IDEAS we have of yellow, white, heat, cold, soft, hard, bitter, sweet, and all those which we call sensible qualities; which when I say the senses convey into the mind, I mean, they from external objects convey into the mind what produces there those perceptions. This great source of most of the ideas we have, depending wholly upon our senses, and derived by them to the understanding, I call SENSATION. \\4. The Operations of our Minds, the other Source of them. Secondly, the other fountain from which experience furnisheth the understanding with ideas is,—the perception of the operations of our own mind within us, as it is employed about the ideas it has got;—which operations, when the soul comes to reflect on and consider, do furnish the understanding with another set of ideas, which could not be had from things without. And such are perception, thinking, doubting, believing, reasoning, knowing, willing, and all the different actings of our own minds;—which we being conscious of, and observing in ourselves, do from these receive into our understandings as distinct ideas as we do from bodies affecting our senses. This source of ideas every man has wholly in himself; and though it be not sense, as having nothing to do with external objects, yet it is very like it, and might properly enough be called INTERNAL SENSE. But as I call the other Sensation, so I call this REFLECTION, the ideas it affords being such only as the mind gets by reflecting on its own operations within itself. By reflection then, in the following part of this discourse, I would be understood to mean, that notice which the mind takes of its own operations, and the manner of them, by reason whereof there come to be ideas of these operations in the understanding. These two, I say, viz. external material things, as the objects of SENSATION, and the operations of our own minds within, as the objects of REFLECTION, are to","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:9:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER II.—OF SIMPLE IDEAS. \\1. Uncompounded Appearances. The better to understand the nature, manner, and extent of our knowledge, one thing is carefully to be observed concerning the ideas we have; and that is, that some of them, are SIMPLE and some COMPLEX. Though the qualities that affect our senses are, in the things themselves, so united and blended, that there is no separation, no distance between them; yet it is plain, the ideas they produce in the mind enter by the senses simple; and unmixed. For, though the sight and touch often take in from the same object, at the same time, different ideas;—as a man sees at once motion and colour; the hand feels softness and warmth in the same piece of wax: yet the simple ideas thus united in the same subject, are as perfectly distinct as those that come in by different senses. The coldness and hardness which a man feels in a piece of ice being as distinct ideas in the mind as the smell and whiteness of a lily; or as the taste of sugar, and smell of a rose. And there is nothing can be plainer to a man than the clear and distinct perception he has of those simple ideas; which, being each in itself uncompounded, contains in it nothing but ONE UNIFORM APPEARANCE, OR CONCEPTION IN THE MIND, and is not distinguishable into different ideas. \\2. The Mind can neither make nor destroy them. These simple ideas, the materials of all our knowledge, are suggested and furnished to the mind only by those two ways above mentioned, viz. sensation and reflection. When the understanding is once stored with these simple ideas, it has the power to repeat, compare, and unite them, even to an almost infinite variety, and so can make at pleasure new complex ideas. But it is not in the power of the most exalted wit, or enlarged understanding, by any quickness or variety of thought, to INVENT or FRAME one new simple idea in the mind, not taken in by the ways before mentioned: nor can any force of the understanding DESTROY those that are there. The dominion of man, in this little world of his own understanding being much what the same as it is in the great world of visible things; wherein his power, however managed by art and skill, reaches no farther than to compound and divide the materials that are made to his hand; but can do nothing towards the making the least particle of new matter, or destroying one atom of what is already in being. The same inability will every one find in himself, who shall go about to fashion in his understanding one simple idea, not received in by his senses from external objects, or by reflection from the operations of his own mind about them. I would have any one try to fancy any taste which had never affected his palate; or frame the idea of a scent he had never smelt: and when he can do this, I will also conclude that a blind man hath ideas of colours, and a deaf man true distinct notions of sounds. \\3. Only the qualities that affect the senses are imaginable. This is the reason why—though we cannot believe it impossible to God to make a creature with other organs, and more ways to convey into the understanding the notice of corporeal things than those five, as they are usually counted, which he has given to man—yet I think it is not possible for any MAN to imagine any other qualities in bodies, howsoever constituted, whereby they can be taken notice of, besides sounds, tastes, smells, visible and tangible qualities. And had mankind been made but with four senses, the qualities then which are the objects of the fifth sense had been as far from our notice, imagination, and conception, as now any belonging to a sixth, seventh, or eighth sense can possibly be;—which, whether yet some other creatures, in some other parts of this vast and stupendous universe, may not have, will be a great presumption to deny.

Division of simple ideas. The better to conceive the ideas we receive from sensation, it may not be amiss for us to consider them, in reference to the different ways whereby they make their approaches to our minds, and make themselves perceivable by us. FIRST, then, There are some which come into our minds BY ONE SENSE ONLY. SECONDLY, There are others that convey themselves into the mind BY MORE SENSES THAN ONE. THIRDLY, Others that are had from REFLECTION ONLY. FOURTHLY, There are some that make themselves way, and are suggested to the mind BY ALL THE WAYS OF SENSATION AND REFLECTION. We shall consider them apart under these several heads. Ideas of one Sense. There are some ideas which have admittance only through one sense, which is peculiarly adapted to receive them. Thus light and colours, as white, red, yellow, blue; with their several degrees or shades and mixtures, as green, scarlet, purple, sea-green, and the rest, come in only by the eyes. All kinds of noises, sounds, and tones, only by the ears. The several tastes and smells, by the nose and palate. And if these organs, or the nerves which are the conduits to convey them from without to their audience in the brain,—the mind’s presence-room (as I may so call it)—are any of them so disordered as not to perform their functions, they have no postern to be admitted by; no other way to bring themselves into view, and be perceived by the understanding. The most considerable of those belonging to the touch, are heat and cold, and solidity: all the rest, consisting almost wholly in the sensible configuration, as smooth and rough; or else, more or less firm adhesion of the parts, as hard and soft, tough and brittle, are obvious enough. \\2. Few simple Ideas have Names. I think it will be needless to enumerate all the particular simple ideas belonging to each sense. Nor indeed is it possible if we would; there being a great many more of them belonging to most of the senses than we have names for. The variety of smells, which are as many almost, if not more, than species of bodies in the world, do most of them want names. Sweet and stinking commonly serve our turn for these ideas, which in effect is little more than to call them pleasing or displeasing; though the smell of a rose and violet, both sweet, are certainly very distinct ideas. Nor are the different tastes, that by our palates we receive ideas of, much better provided with names. Sweet, bitter, sour, harsh, and salt are almost all the epithets we have to denominate that numberless variety of relishes, which are to be found distinct, not only in almost every sort of creatures, but in the different parts of the same plant, fruit, or animal. The same may be said of colours and sounds. I shall, therefore, in the account of simple ideas I am here giving, content myself to set down only such as are most material to our present purpose, or are in themselves less apt to be taken notice of though they are very frequently the ingredients of our complex ideas; amongst which, I think, I may well account solidity, which therefore I shall treat of in the next chapter.

We receive this Idea from Touch. The idea of SOLIDITY we receive by our touch: and it arises from the resistance which we find in body to the entrance of any other body into the place it possesses, till it has left it. There is no idea which we receive more constantly from sensation than solidity. Whether we move or rest, in what posture soever we are, we always feel something under us that supports us, and hinders our further sinking downwards; and the bodies which we daily handle make us perceive that, whilst they remain between them, they do, by an insurmountable force, hinder the approach of the parts of our hands that press them. THAT WHICH THUS HINDERS THE APPROACH OF TWO BODIES, WHEN THEY ARE MOVED ONE TOWARDS ANOTHER, I CALL SOLIDITY. I will not dispute whether this acceptation of the word solid be nearer to its original signification than that which mathematicians use it in. It suffices that I think the common notion of solidity will allow, if not justify, this use of it; but if any one think it better to call it IMPENETRABILITY, he has my consent. Only I have thought the term solidity the more proper to express this idea, not only because of its vulgar use in that sense, but also because it carries something more of positive in it than impenetrability; which is negative, and is perhaps more a consequence of solidity, than solidity itself. This, of all other, seems the idea most intimately connected with, and essential to body; so as nowhere else to be found or imagined, but only in matter. And though our senses take no notice of it, but in masses of matter, of a bulk sufficient to cause a sensation in us: yet the mind, having once got this idea from such grosser sensible bodies, traces it further, and considers it, as well as figure, in the minutest particle of matter that can exist; and finds it inseparably inherent in body, wherever or however modified. \\2. Solidity fills Space. This is the idea which belongs to body, whereby we conceive it to fill space. The idea of which filling of space is,—that where we imagine any space taken up by a solid substance, we conceive it so to possess it, that it excludes all other solid substances; and will for ever hinder any other two bodies, that move towards one another in a straight line, from coming to touch one another, unless it removes from between them in a line not parallel to that which they move in. This idea of it, the bodies which we ordinarily handle sufficiently furnish us with. \\3. Distinct from Space. This resistance, whereby it keeps other bodies out of the space which it possesses, is so great, that no force, how great soever, can surmount it. All the bodies in the world, pressing a drop of water on all sides, will never be able to overcome the resistance which it will make, soft as it is, to their approaching one another, till it be removed out of their way: whereby our idea of solidity is distinguished both from pure space, which is capable neither of resistance nor motion; and from the ordinary idea of hardness. For a man may conceive two bodies at a distance, so as they may approach one another, without touching or displacing any solid thing, till their superficies come to meet; whereby, I think, we have the clear idea of space without solidity. For (not to go so far as annihilation of any particular body) I ask, whether a man cannot have the idea of the motion of one single body alone, without any other succeeding immediately into its place? I think it is evident he can: the idea of motion in one body no more including the idea of motion in another, than the idea of a square figure in one body includes the idea of a square figure in another. I do not ask, whether bodies do so EXIST, that the motion of one body cannot really be without the motion of another. To determine this either way, is to beg the question for or against a VACUUM. But my question is,—whether one cannot have the IDEA of one body moved, whilst others are ","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:12:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER V.—OF SIMPLE IDEAS OF DIVERS SENSES.

Simple Ideas are the Operations of Mind about its other Ideas. The mind receiving the ideas mentioned in the foregoing chapters from without, when it turns its view inward upon itself, and observes its own actions about those ideas it has, takes from thence other ideas, which are as capable to be the objects of its contemplation as any of those it received from foreign things. The Idea of Perception, and Idea of Willing, we have from Reflection. The two great and principal actions of the mind, which are most frequently considered, and which are so frequent that every one that pleases may take notice of them in himself, are these two:— PERCEPTION, or THINKING; and VOLITION, or WILLING. The power of thinking is called the UNDERSTANDING, and the power of volition is called the WILL; and these two powers or abilities in the mind are denominated faculties. Of some of the MODES of these simple ideas of reflection, such as are REMEMBRANCE, DISCERNING, REASONING, JUDGING, KNOWLEDGE, FAITH, \u0026c., I shall have occasion to speak hereafter.

Ideas of Pleasure and Pain. There be other simple ideas which convey themselves into the mind by all the ways of sensation and reflection, viz. PLEASURE or DELIGHT, and its opposite, PAIN, or UNEASINESS; POWER; EXISTENCE; UNITY mix with almost all our other Ideas. \\2. Delight or uneasiness, one or other of them, join themselves to almost all our ideas both of sensation and reflection: and there is scarce any affection of our senses from without, any retired thought of our mind within, which is not able to produce in us pleasure or pain. By pleasure and pain, I would be understood to signify, whatsoever delights or molests us; whether it arises from the thoughts of our minds, or anything operating on our bodies. For, whether we call it; satisfaction, delight, pleasure, happiness, \u0026c., on the one side, or uneasiness, trouble, pain, torment, anguish, misery, \u0026c., the other, they are still but different degrees of the same thing, and belong to the ideas of pleasure and pain, delight or uneasiness; which are the names I shall most commonly use for those two sorts of ideas. \\3. As motives of our actions. The infinite wise Author of our being, having given us the power over several parts of our bodies, to move or keep them at rest as we think fit; and also, by the motion of them, to move ourselves and other contiguous bodies, in which consist all the actions of our body: having also given a power to our minds, in several instances, to choose, amongst its ideas, which it will think on, and to pursue the inquiry of this or that subject with consideration and attention, to excite us to these actions of thinking and motion that we are capable of,—has been pleased to join to several thoughts, and several sensations a perception of delight. If this were wholly separated from all our outward sensations, and inward thoughts, we should have no reason to prefer one thought or action to another; negligence to attention, or motion to rest. And so we should neither stir our bodies, nor employ our minds, but let our thoughts (if I may so call it) run adrift, without any direction or design, and suffer the ideas of our minds, like unregarded shadows, to make their appearances there, as it happened, without attending to them. In which state man, however furnished with the faculties of understanding and will, would be a very idle, inactive creature, and pass his time only in a lazy, lethargic dream. It has therefore pleased our wise Creator to annex to several objects, and the ideas which we receive from them, as also to several of our thoughts, a concomitant pleasure, and that in several objects, to several degrees, that those faculties which he had endowed us with might not remain wholly idle and unemployed by us. \\4. An end and use of pain. Pain has the same efficacy and use to set us on work that pleasure has, we being as ready to employ our faculties to avoid that, as to pursue this: only this is worth our consideration, that pain is often produced by the same objects and ideas that produce pleasure in us. This their near conjunction, which makes us often feel pain in the sensations where we expected pleasure, gives us new occasion of admiring the wisdom and goodness of our Maker, who, designing the preservation of our being, has annexed pain to the application of many things to our bodies, to warn us of the harm that they will do, and as advices to withdraw from them. But he, not designing our preservation barely, but the preservation of every part and organ in its perfection, hath in many cases annexed pain to those very ideas which delight us. Thus heat, that is very agreeable to us in one degree, by a little greater increase of it proves no ordinary torment: and the most pleasant of all sensible objects, light itself, if there be too much of it, if increased beyond a due proportion to our eyes, causes a very painful sensation.

Positive Ideas from privative causes. Concerning the simple ideas of Sensation; it is to be considered,—that whatsoever is so constituted in nature as to be able, by affecting our senses, to cause any perception in the mind, doth thereby produce in the understanding a simple idea; which, whatever be the external cause of it, when it comes to be taken notice of by our discerning faculty, it is by the mind looked on and considered there to be a real positive idea in the understanding, as much as any other whatsoever; though, perhaps, the cause of it be but a privation of the subject. \\2. Ideas in the mind distinguished from that in things which gives rise to them. Thus the ideas of heat and cold, light and darkness, white and black, motion and rest, are equally clear and positive ideas in the mind; though, perhaps, some of the causes which produce them are barely privations, in those subjects from whence our senses derive those ideas. These the understanding, in its view of them, considers all as distinct positive ideas, without taking notice of the causes that produce them: which is an inquiry not belonging to the idea, as it is in the understanding, but to the nature of the things existing without us. These are two very different things, and carefully to be distinguished; it being one thing to perceive and know the idea of white or black, and quite another to examine what kind of particles they must be, and how ranged in the superficies, to make any object appear white or black. \\3. We may have the ideas when we are ignorant of their physical causes. A painter or dyer who never inquired into their causes hath the ideas of white and black, and other colours, as clearly, perfectly, and distinctly in his understanding, and perhaps more distinctly, than the philosopher who hath busied himself in considering their natures, and thinks he knows how far either of them is, in its cause, positive or privative; and the idea of black is no less positive in his mind than that of white, however the cause of that colour in the external object may be only a privation. \\4. Why a privative cause in nature may occasion a positive idea. If it were the design of my present undertaking to inquire into the natural causes and manner of perception, I should offer this as a reason why a privative cause might, in some cases at least, produce a positive idea; viz. that all sensation being produced in us only by different degrees and modes of motion in our animal spirits, variously agitated by external objects, the abatement of any former motion must as necessarily produce a new sensation as the variation or increase of it; and so introduce a new idea, which depends only on a different motion of the animal spirits in that organ. \\5. Negative names need not be meaningless. But whether this be so or not I will not here determine, but appeal to every one’s own experience, whether the shadow of a man, though it consists of nothing but the absence of light (and the more the absence of light is, the more discernible is the shadow) does not, when a man looks on it, cause as clear and positive idea in his mind, as a man himself, though covered over with clear sunshine? And the picture of a shadow is a positive thing. Indeed, we have negative names, to which there be no positive ideas; but they consist wholly in negation of some certain ideas, as SILENCE, INVISIBLE; but these signify not any ideas in the mind but their absence. \\6. Whether any ideas are due to causes really private. And thus one may truly be said to see darkness. For, supposing a hole perfectly dark, from whence no light is reflected, it is certain one may see the figure of it, or it may be painted; or whether the ink I write with makes any other idea, is a question. The privative causes I have here assigned of positive ideas are according to the common opinion; but, in truth, it will be hard to determine wheth","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:16:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER IX.—OF PERCEPTION. \\1. Perception the first simple Idea of Reflection. PERCEPTION, as it is the first faculty of the mind exercised about our ideas; so it is the first and simplest idea we have from reflection, and is by some called thinking in general. Though thinking, in the propriety of the English tongue, signifies that sort of operation in the mind about its ideas, wherein the mind is active; where it, with some degree of voluntary attention, considers anything. For in bare naked perception, the mind is, for the most part, only passive; and what it perceives, it cannot avoid perceiving. \\2. Reflection alone can give us the idea of what perception is. What perception is, every one will know better by reflecting on what he does himself, when he sees, hears, feels, \u0026c., or thinks, than by any discourse of mine. Whoever reflects on what passes in his own mind cannot miss it. And if he does not reflect, all the words in the world cannot make him have any notion of it. \\3. Arises in sensation only when the mind notices the organic impression. This is certain, that whatever alterations are made in the body, if they reach not the mind; whatever impressions are made on the outward parts, if they are not taken notice of within, there is no perception. Fire may burn our bodies with no other effect than it does a billet, unless the motion be continued to the brain, and there the sense of heat, or idea of pain, be produced in the mind; wherein consists actual perception. \\4. Impulse on the organ insufficient. How often may a man observe in himself, that whilst his mind is intently employed in the contemplation of some objects, and curiously surveying some ideas that are there, it takes no notice of impressions of sounding bodies made upon the organ of hearing, with the same alteration that uses to be for the producing the idea of sound? A sufficient impulse there may be on the organ; but it not reaching the observation of the mind, there follows no perception: and though the motion that uses to produce the idea of sound be made in the ear, yet no sound is heard. Want of sensation, in this case, is not through any defect in the organ, or that the man’s ears are less affected than at other times when he does hear but that which uses to produce the idea, though conveyed in by the usual organ, not being taken notice of in the understanding, and so imprinting no idea in the mind, there follows no sensation. So that wherever there is sense of perception, there some idea is actually produced, and present in the understanding. \\5. Children, though they may have Ideas in the Womb, have none innate. Therefore I doubt not but children, by the exercise of their senses about objects that affect them in the womb receive some few ideas before they are born, as the unavoidable effects, either of the bodies that environ them, or else of those wants or diseases they suffer; amongst which (if one may conjecture concerning things not very capable of examination) I think the ideas of hunger and warmth are two: which probably are some of the first that children have, and which they scarce ever part with again. \\6. The effects of Sensation in the womb. But though it be reasonable to imagine that children receive some ideas before they come into the world, yet these simple ideas are far from those INNATE PRINCIPLES which some contend for, and we, above, have rejected. These here mentioned, being the effects of sensation, are only from some affections of the body, which happen to them there, and so depend on something exterior to the mind; no otherwise differing in their manner of production from other ideas derived from sense, but only in the precedency of time. Whereas those innate principles are supposed to be quite of another nature; not coming into the mind by any accidental alterations in, or operations on the body; but, as it were, original characters impressed upon it, in the very first moment of its being and constitution. \\7. Which Ideas app","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:17:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER X.—OF RETENTION. \\1. Contemplation The next faculty of the mind, whereby it makes a further progress towards knowledge, is that which I call RETENTION; or the keeping of those simple ideas which from sensation or reflection it hath received. This is done two ways. First, by keeping the idea which is brought into it, for some time actually in view, which is called CONTEMPLATION. \\2. Memory. The other way of retention is, the power to revive again in our minds those ideas which, after imprinting, have disappeared, or have been as it were laid aside out of sight. And thus we do, when we conceive heat or light, yellow or sweet,—the object being removed. This is MEMORY, which is as it were the storehouse of our ideas. For, the narrow mind of man not being capable of having many ideas under view and consideration at once, it was necessary to have a repository, to lay up those ideas which, at another time, it might have use of. But, our IDEAS being nothing but actual perceptions in the mind, which cease to be anything; when there is no perception of them; this laying up of our ideas in the repository of the memory signifies no more but this,—that the mind has a power in many cases to revive perceptions which it has once had, with this additional perception annexed to them, that IT HAS HAD THEM BEFORE. And in this sense it is that our ideas are said to be in our memories, when indeed they are actually nowhere;—but only there is an ability in the mind when it will to revive them again, and as it were paint them anew on itself, though some with more, some with less difficulty; some more lively, and others more obscurely. And thus it is, by the assistance of this faculty, that we are said to have all those ideas in our understandings which, though we do not actually contemplate yet we CAN bring in sight, and make appear again, and be the objects of our thoughts, without the help of those sensible qualities which first imprinted them there. \\3. Attention, Repetition, Pleasure and Pain, fix Ideas. Attention and repetition help much to the fixing any ideas in the memory. But those which naturally at first make the deepest and most lasting impressions, are those which are accompanied with pleasure or pain. The great business of the senses being, to make us take notice of what hurts or advantages the body, it is wisely ordered by nature, as has been shown, that pain should accompany the reception of several ideas; which, supplying the place of consideration and reasoning in children, and acting quicker than consideration in grown men, makes both the old and young avoid painful objects with that haste which is necessary for their preservation; and in both settles in the memory a caution for the future. \\4. Ideas fade in the Memory. Concerning the several degrees of lasting, wherewith ideas are imprinted on the memory, we may observe,—that some of them have been produced in the understanding by an object affecting the senses once only, and no more than once; others, that have more than once offered themselves to the senses, have yet been little taken notice of: the mind, either heedless, as in children, or otherwise employed, as in men intent only on one thing; not setting the stamp deep into itself. And in some, where they are set on with care and repeated impressions, either through the temper of the body, or some other fault, the memory is very weak. In all these cases, ideas in the mind quickly fade, and often vanish quite out of the understanding, leaving no more footsteps or remaining characters of themselves than shadows do flying over fields of corn, and the mind is as void of them as if they had never been there. \\5. Causes of oblivion. Thus many of those ideas which were produced in the minds of children, in the beginning of their sensation, (some of which perhaps, as of some pleasures and pains, were before they were born, and others in their infancy,) if in the future course of their lives they are not repeated again, are qu","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:18:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XI.—OF DISCERNING, AND OTHER OPERATIONS OF THE MIND. \\1. No Knowledge without Discernment. Another faculty we may take notice of in our minds is that of DISCERNING and DISTINGUISHING between the several ideas it has. It is not enough to have a confused perception of something in general. Unless the mind had a distinct perception of different objects and their qualities, it would be capable of very little knowledge, though the bodies that affect us were as busy about us as they are now, and the mind were continually employed in thinking. On this faculty of distinguishing one thing from another depends the evidence and certainty of several, even very general, propositions, which have passed for innate truths;—because men, overlooking the true cause why those propositions find universal assent, impute it wholly to native uniform impressions; whereas it in truth depends upon this clear discerning faculty of the mind, whereby it PERCEIVES two ideas to be the same, or different. But of this more hereafter. \\2. The Difference of Wit and Judgment. How much the imperfection of accurately discriminating ideas one from another lies, either in the dulness or faults of the organs of sense; or want of acuteness, exercise, or attention in the understanding; or hastiness and precipitancy, natural to some tempers, I will not here examine: it suffices to take notice, that this is one of the operations that the mind may reflect on and observe in itself. It is of that consequence to its other knowledge, that so far as this faculty is in itself dull, or not rightly made use of, for the distinguishing one thing from another,—so far our notions are confused, and our reason and judgment disturbed or misled. If in having our ideas in the memory ready at hand consists quickness of parts; in this, of having them unconfused, and being able nicely to distinguish one thing from another, where there is but the least difference, consists, in a great measure, the exactness of judgment, and clearness of reason, which is to be observed in one man above another. And hence perhaps may be given some reason of that common observation,—that men who have a great deal of wit, and prompt memories, have not always the clearest judgment or deepest reason. For WIT lying most in the assemblage of ideas, and putting those together with quickness and variety, wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity, thereby to make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the fancy; JUDGMENT, on the contrary, lies quite on the other side, in separating carefully, one from another, ideas wherein can be found the least difference, thereby to avoid being misled by similitude, and by affinity to take one thing for another. This is a way of proceeding quite contrary to metaphor and allusion; wherein for the most part lies that entertainment and pleasantry of wit, which strikes so lively on the fancy, and therefore is so acceptable to all people, because its beauty appears at first sight, and there is required no labour of thought to examine what truth or reason there is in it. The mind, without looking any further, rests satisfied with the agreeableness of the picture and the gaiety of the fancy. And it is a kind of affront to go about to examine it, by the severe rules of truth and good reason; whereby it appears that it consists in something that is not perfectly conformable to them. \\3. Clearness alone hinders Confusion. To the well distinguishing our ideas, it chiefly contributes that they be CLEAR and DETERMINATE. And when they are so, it will not breed any confusion or mistake about them, though the senses should (as sometimes they do) convey them from the same object differently on different occasions, and so seem to err. For, though a man in a fever should from sugar have a bitter taste, which at another time would produce a sweet one, yet the idea of bitter in that man’s mind would be as clear and distinct from the idea of sweet as if he had tasted only gall.

Made by the Mind out of simple Ones. We have hitherto considered those ideas, in the reception whereof the mind is only passive, which are those simple ones received from sensation and reflection before mentioned, whereof the mind cannot make one to itself, nor have any idea which does not wholly consist of them. As simple ideas are observed to exist in several combinations united together, so the mind has a power to consider several of them united together as one idea; and that not only as they are united in external objects, but as itself has joined them together. Ideas thus made up of several simple ones put together, I call COMPLEX;—such as are beauty, gratitude, a man, an army, the universe; which, though complicated of various simple ideas, or complex ideas made up of simple ones, yet are, when the mind pleases, considered each by itself, as one entire thing, signified by one name. \\2. Made voluntarily. In this faculty of repeating and joining together its ideas, the mind has great power in varying and multiplying the objects of its thoughts, infinitely beyond what sensation or reflection furnished it with: but all this still confined to those simple ideas which it received from those two sources, and which are the ultimate materials of all its compositions. For simple ideas are all from things themselves, and of these the mind CAN have no more, nor other than what are suggested to it. It can have no other ideas of sensible qualities than what come from without [*dropped word] the senses; nor any ideas of other kind of operations of a thinking substance, than what it finds in itself. But when it has once got these simple ideas, it is not confined barely to observation, and what offers itself from without; it can, by its own power, put together those ideas it has, and make new complex ones, which it never received so united. \\3. Complex ideas are either of Modes, Substances, or Relations. COMPLEX IDEAS, however compounded and decompounded, though their number be infinite, and the variety endless, wherewith they fill and entertain the thoughts of men; yet I think they may be all reduced under these three heads:—1. MODES. 2. SUBSTANCES. 3. RELATIONS. \\4. Ideas of Modes. First, MODES I call such complex ideas which, however compounded, contain not in them the supposition of subsisting by themselves, but are considered as dependences on, or affections of substances;—such as are the ideas signified by the words triangle, gratitude, murder, \u0026c. And if in this I use the word mode in somewhat a different sense from its ordinary signification, I beg pardon; it being unavoidable in discourses, differing from the ordinary received notions, either to make new words, or to use old words in somewhat a new signification; the later whereof, in our present case, is perhaps the more tolerable of the two. \\5. Simple and mixed Modes of Ideas. Of these MODES, there are two sorts which deserve distinct consideration:— First, there are some which are only variations, or different combinations of the same simple idea, without the mixture of any other;—as a dozen, or score; which are nothing but the ideas of so many distinct units added together, and these I call SIMPLE MODES as being contained within the bounds of one simple idea. Secondly, there are others compounded of simple ideas of several kinds, put together to make one complex one;—v.g. beauty, consisting of a certain composition of colour and figure, causing delight to the beholder; theft, which being the concealed change of the possession of anything, without the consent of the proprietor, contains, as is visible, a combination of several ideas of several kinds: and these I call MIXED MODES. \\6. Ideas of Substances, single or collective. Secondly, the ideas of SUBSTANCES are such combinations of simple ideas as are taken to represent distinct PARTICULAR things subsisting by themselves; in which the supposed or confused idea of substance, such as it is,","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:20:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XIII.—COMPLEX IDEAS OF SIMPLE MODES:—AND FIRST, OF THE SIMPLE MODES OF IDEA OF SPACE. \\1. Simple modes of simple ideas. Though in the foregoing part I have often mentioned simple ideas, which are truly the materials of all our knowledge; yet having treated of them there, rather in the way that they come into the mind, than as distinguished from others more compounded, it will not be perhaps amiss to take a view of some of them again under this consideration, and examine those different modifications of the SAME idea; which the mind either finds in things existing, or is able to make within itself without the help of any extrinsical object, or any foreign suggestion. Those modifications of any ONE simple idea (which, as has been said, I call SIMPLE MODES) are as perfectly different and distinct ideas in the mind as those of the greatest distance or contrariety. For the idea of two is as distinct from that of one, as blueness from heat, or either of them from any number: and yet it is made up only of that simple idea of an unit repeated; and repetitions of this kind joined together make those distinct simple modes, of a dozen, a gross, a million. Simple Modes of Idea of Space. \\2. Idea of Space. I shall begin with the simple idea of SPACE. I have showed above, chap. 4, that we get the idea of space, both by our sight and touch; which, I think, is so evident, that it would be as needless to go to prove that men perceive, by their sight, a distance between bodies of different colours, or between the parts of the same body, as that they see colours themselves: nor is it less obvious, that they can do so in the dark by feeling and touch. \\3. Space and Extension. This space, considered barely in length between any two beings, without considering anything else between them, is called DISTANCE: if considered in length, breadth, and thickness, I think it may be called CAPACITY. When considered between the extremities of matter, which fills the capacity of space with something solid, tangible, and moveable, it is properly called EXTENSION. And so extension is an idea belonging to body only; but space may, as is evident, be considered without it. At least I think it most intelligible, and the best way to avoid confusion, if we use the word extension for an affection of matter or the distance of the extremities of particular solid bodies; and space in the more general signification, for distance, with or without solid matter possessing it. \\4. Immensity. Each different distance is a different modification of space; and each idea of any different distance, or space, is a SIMPLE MODE of this idea. Men having, by accustoming themselves to stated lengths of space, which they use for measuring other distances—as a foot, a yard or a fathom, a league, or diameter of the earth—made those ideas familiar to their thoughts, can, in their minds, repeat them as often as they will, without mixing or joining to them the idea of body, or anything else; and frame to themselves the ideas of long, square, or cubic feet, yards or fathoms, here amongst the bodies of the universe, or else beyond the utmost bounds of all bodies; and, by adding these still one to another, enlarge their ideas of space as much as they please. The power of repeating or doubling any idea we have of any distance, and adding it to the former as often as we will, without being ever able to come to any stop or stint, let us enlarge it as much as we will, is that which gives us the idea of IMMENSITY. \\5. Figure. There is another modification of this idea, which is nothing but the relation which the parts of the termination of extension, or circumscribed space, have amongst themselves. This the touch discovers in sensible bodies, whose extremities come within our reach; and the eye takes both from bodies and colours, whose boundaries are within its view: where, observing how the extremities terminate,—either in straight lines which meet at discernible angles, or in crooked lines wh","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:21:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XIV.—IDEA OF DURATION AND ITS SIMPLE MODES. \\1. Duration is fleeting Extension. There is another sort of distance, or length, the idea whereof we get not from the permanent parts of space, but from the fleeting and perpetually perishing parts of succession. This we call DURATION; the simple modes whereof are any different lengths of it whereof we have distinct ideas, as HOURS, DAYS, YEARS, \u0026c., TIME and ETERNITY. \\2. Its Idea from Reflection on the Train of our Ideas. The answer of a great man, to one who asked what time was: Si non rogas intelligo, (which amounts to this; The more I set myself to think of it, the less I understand it,) might perhaps persuade one that time, which reveals all other things, is itself not to be discovered. Duration, time, and eternity, are, not without reason, thought to have something very abstruse in their nature. But however remote these may seem from our comprehension, yet if we trace them right to their originals, I doubt not but one of those sources of all our knowledge, viz. sensation and reflection, will be able to furnish us with these ideas, as clear and distinct as many others which are thought much less obscure; and we shall find that the idea of eternity itself is derived from the same common original with the rest of our ideas. \\3. Nature and origin of the idea of Duration. To understand TIME and ETERNITY aright, we ought with attention to consider what idea it is we have of DURATION, and how we came by it. It is evident to any one who will but observe what passes in his own mind, that there is a train of ideas which constantly succeed one another in his understanding, as long as he is awake. Reflection on these appearances of several ideas one after another in our minds, is that which furnishes us with the idea of SUCCESSION: and the distance between any parts of that succession, or between the appearance of any two ideas in our minds, is that we call DURATION. For whilst we are thinking, or whilst we receive successively several ideas in our minds, we know that we do exist; and so we call the existence, or the continuation of the existence of ourselves, or anything else, commensurate to the succession of any ideas in our minds, the duration of ourselves, or any such other thing co-existent with our thinking. \\4. Proof that its idea is got from reflection on the train of our ideas. That we have our notion of succession and duration from this original, viz. from reflection on the train of ideas, which we find to appear one after another in our own minds, seems plain to me, in that we have no perception of duration but by considering the train of ideas that take their turns in our understandings. When that succession of ideas ceases, our perception of duration ceases with it; which every one clearly experiments in himself, whilst he sleeps soundly, whether an hour or a day, a month or a year; of which duration of things, while he sleeps or thinks not, he has no perception at all, but it is quite lost to him; and the moment wherein he leaves off to think, till the moment he begins to think again, seems to him to have no distance. And so I doubt not it would be to a waking man, if it were possible for him to keep ONLY ONE idea in his mind, without variation and the succession of others. And we see, that one who fixes his thoughts very intently on one thing, so as to take but little notice of the succession of ideas that pass in his mind whilst he is taken up with that earnest contemplation, lets slip out of his account a good part of that duration, and thinks that time shorter than it is. But if sleep commonly unites the distant parts of duration, it is because during that time we have no succession of ideas in our minds. For if a man, during his sleep, dreams, and variety of ideas make themselves perceptible in his mind one after another, he hath then, during such dreaming, a sense of duration, and of the length of it. By which it is to me very clear, that men derive their ide","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:22:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XV.—IDEAS OF DURATION AND EXPANSION, CONSIDERED TOGETHER. \\1. Both capable of greater and less. Though we have in the precedent chapters dwelt pretty long on the considerations of space and duration, yet, they being ideas of general concernment, that have something very abstruse and peculiar in their nature, the comparing them one with another may perhaps be of use for their illustration; and we may have the more clear and distinct conception of them by taking a view of them together. Distance or space, in its simple abstract conception, to avoid confusion, I call EXPANSION, to distinguish it from extension, which by some is used to express this distance only as it is in the solid parts of matter, and so includes, or at least intimates, the idea of body: whereas the idea of pure distance includes no such thing. I prefer also the word expansion to space, because space is often applied to distance of fleeting successive parts, which never exist together, as well as to those which are permanent. In both these (viz. expansion and duration) the mind has this common idea of continued lengths, capable of greater or less quantities. For a man has as clear an idea of the difference of the length of an hour and a day, as of an inch and a foot. \\2. Expansion not bounded by Matter. The mind, having got the idea of the length of any part of expansion, let it be a span, or a pace, or what length you will, CAN, as has been said, repeat that idea, and so, adding it to the former, enlarge its idea of length, and make it equal to two spans, or two paces; and so, as often as it will, till it equals the distance of any parts of the earth one from another, and increase thus till it amounts to the distance of the sun or remotest star. By such a progression as this, setting out from the place where it is, or any other place, it can proceed and pass beyond all those lengths, and find nothing to stop its going on, either in or without body. It is true, we can easily in our thoughts come to the end of SOLID extension; the extremity and bounds of all body we have no difficulty to arrive at: but when the mind is there, it finds nothing to hinder its progress into this endless expansion; of that it can neither find nor conceive any end. Nor let any one say, that beyond the bounds of body, there is nothing at all; unless he will confine God within the limits of matter. Solomon, whose understanding was filled and enlarged with wisdom, seems to have other thoughts when he says, ‘Heaven, and the heaven of heavens, cannot contain thee.’ And he, I think, very much magnifies to himself the capacity of his own understanding, who persuades himself that he can extend his thoughts further than God exists, or imagine any expansion where He is not. \\3. Nor Duration by Motion. Just so is it in duration. The mind having got the idea of any length of duration, CAN double, multiply, and enlarge it, not only beyond its own, but beyond the existence of all corporeal beings, and all the measures of time, taken from the great bodies of all the world and their motions. But yet every one easily admits, that, though we make duration boundless, as certainly it is, we cannot yet extend it beyond all being. God, every one easily allows, fills eternity; and it is hard to find a reason why any one should doubt that he likewise fills immensity. His infinite being is certainly as boundless one way as another; and methinks it ascribes a little too much to matter to say, where there is no body, there is nothing. \\4. Why Men more easily admit infinite Duration than infinite Expansion. Hence I think we may learn the reason why every one familiarly and without the least hesitation speaks of and supposes Eternity, and sticks not to ascribe INFINITY to DURATION; but it is with more doubting and reserve that many admit or suppose the INFINITY OF SPACE. The reason whereof seems to me to be this,—That duration and extension being used as names of affections belonging to other beings, we ","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:23:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XVI.—IDEA OF NUMBER. \\1. Number the simplest and most universal Idea. Amongst all the ideas we have, as there is none suggested to the mind by more ways, so there is none more simple, than that of UNITY, or one: it has no shadow of variety or composition in it: every object our senses are employed about; every idea in our understandings; every thought of our minds, brings this idea along with it. And therefore it is the most intimate to our thoughts, as well as it is, in its agreement to all other things, the most universal idea we have. For number applies itself to men, angels, actions, thoughts; everything that either doth exist or can be imagined. \\2. Its Modes made by Addition. By repeating this idea in our minds, and adding the repetitions together, we come by the COMPLEX ideas of the MODES of it. Thus, by adding one to one, we have the complex idea of a couple; by putting twelve units together we have the complex idea of a dozen; and so of a score or a million, or any other number. \\3. Each Mode distinct. The SIMPLE MODES of NUMBER are of all other the most distinct; every the least variation, which is an unit, making each combination as clearly different from that which approacheth nearest to it, as the most remote; two being as distinct from one, as two hundred; and the idea of two as distinct from the idea of three, as the magnitude of the whole earth is from that of a mite. This is not so in other simple modes, in which it is not so easy, nor perhaps possible for us to distinguish betwixt two approaching ideas, which yet are really different. For who will undertake to find a difference between the white of this paper and that of the next degree to it: or can form distinct ideas of every the least excess in extension? \\4. Therefore Demonstrations in Numbers the most precise. The clearness and distinctness of each mode of number from all others, even those that approach nearest, makes me apt to think that demonstrations in numbers, if they are not more evident and exact than in extension, yet they are more general in their use, and more determinate in their application. Because the ideas of numbers are more precise and distinguishable than in extension; where every equality and excess are not so easy to be observed or measured; because our thoughts cannot in space arrive at any determined smallness beyond which it cannot go, as an unit; and therefore the quantity or proportion of any the least excess cannot be discovered; which is clear otherwise in number, where, as has been said, 91 is as distinguishable from 90 as from 9000, though 91 be the next immediate excess to 90. But it is not so in extension, where, whatsoever is more than just a foot or an inch, is not distinguishable from the standard of a foot or an inch; and in lines which appear of an equal length, one may be longer than the other by innumerable parts: nor can any one assign an angle, which shall be the next biggest to a right one. \\5. Names necessary to Numbers. By the repeating, as has been said, the idea of an unit, and joining it to another unit, we make thereof one collective idea, marked by the name two. And whosoever can do this, and proceed on, still adding one more to the last collective idea which he had of any number, and gave a name to it, may count, or have ideas, for several collections of units, distinguished one from another, as far as he hath a series of names for following numbers, and a memory to retain that series, with their several names: all numeration being but still the adding of one unit more, and giving to the whole together, as comprehended in one idea, a new or distinct name or sign, whereby to know it from those before and after, and distinguish it from every smaller or greater multitude of units. So that he that can add one to one, and so to two, and so go on with his tale, taking still with him the distinct names belonging to every progression; and so again, by subtracting an unit from each collection, retreat and","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:24:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XVII.—OF INFINITY. \\1. Infinity, in its original Intention, attributed to Space, Duration, and Number. He that would know what kind of idea it is to which we give the name of INFINITY, cannot do it better than by considering to what infinity is by the mind more immediately attributed; and then how the mind comes to frame it. FINITE and INFINITE seem to me to be looked upon by the mind as the MODES OF QUANTITY, and to be attributed primarily in their first designation only to those things which have parts, and are capable of increase or diminution by the addition or subtraction of any the least part: and such are the ideas of space, duration, and number, which we have considered in the foregoing chapters. It is true, that we cannot but be assured, that the great God, of whom and from whom are all things, is incomprehensibly infinite: but yet, when we apply to that first and supreme Being our idea of infinite, in our weak and narrow thoughts, we do it primarily in respect to his duration and ubiquity; and, I think, more figuratively to his power, wisdom, and goodness, and other attributes which are properly inexhaustible and incomprehensible, \u0026c. For, when we call THEM infinite, we have no other idea of this infinity but what carries with it some reflection on, and imitation of, that number or extent of the acts or objects of God’s power, wisdom, and goodness, which can never be supposed so great, or so many, which these attributes will not always surmount and exceed, let us multiply them in our thoughts as far as we can, with all the infinity of endless number. I do not pretend to say how these attributes are in God, who is infinitely beyond the reach of our narrow capacities: they do, without doubt, contain in them all possible perfection: but this, I say, is our way of conceiving them, and these our ideas of their infinity. \\2. The Idea of Finite easily got. Finite then, and infinite, being by the mind looked on as MODIFICATIONS of expansion and duration, the next thing to be considered, is,—HOW THE MIND COMES BY THEM. As for the idea of finite, there is no great difficulty. The obvious portions of extension that affect our senses, carry with them into the mind the idea of finite: and the ordinary periods of succession, whereby we measure time and duration, as hours, days, and years, are bounded lengths. The difficulty is, how we come by those BOUNDLESS IDEAS of eternity and immensity; since the objects we converse with come so much short of any approach or proportion to that largeness. \\3. How we come by the Idea of Infinity. Every one that has any idea of any stated lengths of space, as a foot, finds that he can repeat that idea; and joining it to the former, make the idea of two feet; and by the addition of a third, three feet; and so on, without ever coming to an end of his additions, whether of the same idea of a foot, or, if he pleases, of doubling it, or any other idea he has of any length, as a mile, or diameter of the earth, or of the orbis magnus: for whichever of these he takes, and how often soever he doubles, or any otherwise multiplies it, he finds, that, after he has continued his doubling in his thoughts, and enlarged his idea as much as he pleases, he has no more reason to stop, nor is one jot nearer the end of such addition, than he was at first setting out: the power of enlarging his idea of space by further additions remaining still the same, he hence takes the idea of infinite space. \\4. Our Idea of Space boundless. This, I think, is the way whereby the mind gets the IDEA of infinite space. It is a quite different consideration, to examine whether the mind has the idea of such a boundless space ACTUALLY EXISTING; since our ideas are not always proofs of the existence of things: but yet, since this comes here in our way, I suppose I may say, that we are APT TO THINK that space in itself is actually boundless, to which imagination the idea of space or expansion of itself naturally leads us.

Other simple Modes of simple Ideas of sensation. Though I have, in the foregoing chapters, shown how from simple ideas taken in by sensation, the mind comes to extend itself even to infinity; which, however it may of all others seem most remote from any sensible perception, yet at last hath nothing in it but what is made out of simple ideas: received into the mind by the senses, and afterwards there put together, by the faculty the mind has to repeat its own ideas; —Though, I say, these might be instances enough of simple modes of the simple ideas of sensation, and suffice to show how the mind comes by them, yet I shall, for method’s sake, though briefly, give an account of some few more, and then proceed to more complex ideas. \\2. Simple modes of motion. To slide, roll, tumble, walk, creep, run, dance, leap, skip, and abundance of others that might be named, are words which are no sooner heard but every one who understands English has presently in his mind distinct ideas, which are all but the different modifications of motion. Modes of motion answer those of extension; swift and slow are two different ideas of motion, the measures whereof are made of the distances of time and space put together; so they are complex ideas, comprehending time and space with motion. \\3. Modes of Sounds. The like variety have we in sounds. Every articulate word is a different modification of sound; by which we see that, from the sense of hearing, by such modifications, the mind may be furnished with distinct ideas, to almost an infinite number. Sounds also, besides the distinct cries of birds and beasts, are modified by diversity of notes of different length put together, which make that complex idea called a tune, which a musician may have in his mind when he hears or makes no sound at all, by reflecting on the ideas of those sounds, so put together silently in his own fancy. \\4. Modes of Colours. Those of colours are also very various: some we take notice of as the different degrees, or as they were termed shades, of the same colour. But since we very seldom make assemblages of colours, either for use or delight, but figure is taken in also, and has its part in it, as in painting, weaving, needleworks, \u0026c.;—those which are taken notice of do most commonly belong to MIXED MODES, as being made up of ideas of divers kinds, viz. figure and colour, such as beauty, rainbow, \u0026c. \\5. Modes of Tastes. All compounded tastes and smells are also modes, made up of the simple ideas of those senses. But they, being such as generally we have no names for, are less taken notice of, and cannot be set down in writing; and therefore must be left without enumeration to the thoughts and experience of my reader. \\6. Some simple Modes have no Names. In general it may be observed, that those simple modes which are considered but as different DEGREES of the same simple idea, though they are in themselves many of them very distinct ideas, yet have ordinarily no distinct names, nor are much taken notice of, as distinct ideas, where the difference is but very small between them. Whether men have neglected these modes, and given no names to them, as wanting measures nicely to distinguish them; or because, when they were so distinguished, that knowledge would not be of general or necessary use, I leave it to the thoughts of others. It is sufficient to my purpose to show, that all our simple ideas come to our minds only by sensation and reflection; and that when the mood has them, it can variously repeat and compound them, and so make new complex ideas. But, though white, red, or sweet, \u0026c. have not been modified, or made into complex ideas, by several combinations, so as to be named, and thereby ranked into species; yet some others of the simple ideas, viz. those of unity, duration, and motion, \u0026c., above instanced in, as also power and thinking, have been thus modified to a great variety of complex ideas, with names belonging to them.","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:26:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XIX.—OF THE MODES OF THINKING. \\1. Sensation, Remembrance, Contemplation, \u0026c., modes of thinking. When the mind turns its view inwards upon itself, and contemplates its own actions, THINKING is the first that occurs. In it the mind observes a great variety of modifications, and from thence receives distinct ideas. Thus the perception or thought which actually accompanies, and is annexed to, any impression on the body, made by an external object, being distinct from all other modifications of thinking, furnishes the mind with a distinct idea, which we call SENSATION;—which is, as it were, the actual entrance of any idea into the understanding by the senses. The same idea, when it again recurs without the operation of the like object on the external sensory, is REMEMBRANCE: if it be sought after by the mind, and with pain and endeavour found, and brought again in view, it is RECOLLECTION: if it be held there long under attentive consideration, it is CONTEMPLATION: when ideas float in our mind without any reflection or regard of the understanding, it is that which the French call REVERIE; our language has scarce a name for it: when the ideas that offer themselves (for, as I have observed in another place, whilst we are awake, there will always be a train of ideas succeeding one another in our minds) are taken notice of, and, as it were, registered in the memory, it is ATTENTION: when the mind with great earnestness, and of choice, fixes its view on any idea, considers it on all sides, and will not be called off by the ordinary solicitation of other ideas, it is that we call INTENTION or STUDY: sleep, without dreaming, is rest from all these: and DREAMING itself is the having of ideas (whilst the outward senses are stopped, so that they receive not outward objects with their usual quickness) in the mind, not suggested by any external objects, or known occasion; nor under any choice or conduct of the understanding at all: and whether that which we call ECSTASY be not dreaming with the eyes open, I leave to be examined. \\2. Other modes of thinking. These are some few instances of those various modes of thinking, which the mind may observe in itself, and so have as distinct ideas of as it hath of white and red, a square or a circle. I do not pretend to enumerate them all, nor to treat at large of this set of ideas, which are got from reflection: that would be to make a volume. It suffices to my present purpose to have shown here, by some few examples, of what sort these ideas are, and how the mind comes by them; especially since I shall have occasion hereafter to treat more at large of REASONING, JUDGING, VOLITION, and KNOWLEDGE, which are some of the most considerable operations of the mind, and modes of thinking. \\3. The various degrees of Attention in thinking. But perhaps it may not be an unpardonable digression, nor wholly impertinent to our present design, if we reflect here upon the different state of the mind in thinking, which those instances of attention, reverie, and dreaming, \u0026c., before mentioned, naturally enough suggest. That there are ideas, some or other, always present in the mind of a waking man, every one’s experience convinces him; though the mind employs itself about them with several degrees of attention. Sometimes the mind fixes itself with so much earnestness on the contemplation of some objects, that it turns their ideas on all sides; marks their relations and circumstances; and views every part so nicely and with such intention, that it shuts out all other thoughts, and takes no notice of the ordinary impressions made then on the senses, which at another season would produce very sensible perceptions: at other times it barely observes the train of ideas that succeed in the understanding, without directing and pursuing any of them: and at other times it lets them pass almost quite unregarded, as faint shadows that make no impression. \\4.

Pleasure and Pain, simple Ideas. AMONGST the simple ideas which we receive both from sensation and reflection, PAIN and PLEASURE are two very considerable ones. For as in the body there is sensation barely in itself, or accompanied with pain or pleasure, so the thought or perception of the mind is simply so, or else accompanied also with pleasure or pain, delight or trouble, call it how you please. These, like other simple ideas, cannot be described, nor their names defined; the way of knowing them is, as of the simple ideas of the senses, only by experience. For, to define them by the presence of good or evil, is no otherwise to make them known to us than by making us reflect on what we feel in ourselves, upon the several and various operations of good and evil upon our minds, as they are differently applied to or considered by us. \\2. Good and evil, what. Things then are good or evil, only in reference to pleasure or pain. That we call GOOD, which is apt to cause or increase pleasure, or diminish pain in us; or else to procure or preserve us the possession of any other good or absence of any evil. And, on the contrary, we name that EVIL which is apt to produce or increase any pain, or diminish any pleasure in us: or else to procure us any evil, or deprive us of any good. By pleasure and pain, I must be understood to mean of body or mind, as they are commonly distinguished; though in truth they be only different constitutions of the MIND, sometimes occasioned by disorder in the body, sometimes by thoughts of the mind. \\3. Our passions moved by Good and Evil. Pleasure and pain and that which causes them,—good and evil, are the hinges on which our passions turn. And if we reflect on ourselves, and observe how these, under various considerations, operate in us; what modifications or tempers of mind, what internal sensations (if I may so call them) they produce in us we may thence form to ourselves the ideas of our passions. \\4. Love. Thus any one reflecting upon the thought he has of the delight which any present or absent thing is apt to produce in him, has the idea we call LOVE. For when a man declares in autumn when he is eating them, or in spring when there are none, that he loves grapes, it is no more but that the taste of grapes delights him: let an alteration of health or constitution destroy the delight of their taste, and he then can be said to love grapes no longer. \\5. Hatred. On the contrary, the thought of the pain which anything present or absent is apt to produce in us, is what we call HATRED. Were it my business here to inquire any further than into the bare ideas of our passions, as they depend on different modifications of pleasure and pain, I should remark that our love and hatred of inanimate insensible beings is commonly founded on that pleasure and pain which we receive from their use and application any way to our senses though with their destruction. But hatred or love, to beings capable of happiness or misery, is often the uneasiness of delight which we find in ourselves, arising from their very being or happiness. Thus the being and welfare of a man’s children or friends, producing constant delight in him, he is said constantly to love them. But it suffices to note, that our ideas of love and hatred are but the dispositions of the mind, in respect of pleasure and pain in general, however caused in us. \\6. Desire. The uneasiness a man finds in himself upon the absence of anything whose present enjoyment carries the idea of delight with it, is that we call DESIRE; which is greater or less as that uneasiness is more or less vehement. Where, by the by, it may perhaps be of some use to remark, that the chief, if not only spur to human industry and action is UNEASINESS.

This Idea how got. The mind being every day informed, by the senses, of the alteration of those simple ideas it observes in things without; and taking notice how one comes to an end, and ceases to be, and another begins to exist which was not before; reflecting also on what passes within itself, and observing a constant change of its ideas, sometimes by the impression of outward objects on the senses, and sometimes by the determination of its own choice; and concluding from what it has so constantly observed to have been, that the like changes will for the future be made in the same things, by like agents, and by the like ways,—considers in one thing the possibility of having any of its simple ideas changed, and in another the possibility of making that change; and so comes by that idea which we call POWER. Thus we say, Fire has a power to melt gold, i. e. to destroy the consistency of its insensible parts, and consequently its hardness, and make it fluid; and gold has a power to be melted; that the sun has a power to blanch wax, and wax a power to be blanched by the sun, whereby the yellowness is destroyed, and whiteness made to exist in its room. In which, and the like cases, the power we consider is in reference to the change of perceivable ideas. For we cannot observe any alteration to be made in, or operation upon anything, but by the observable change of its sensible ideas; nor conceive any alteration to be made, but by conceiving a change of some of its ideas. \\2. Power, active and passive. Power thus considered is two-fold, viz. as able to make, or able to receive any change. The one may be called ACTIVE, and the other PASSIVE power. Whether matter be not wholly destitute of active power, as its author, God, is truly above all passive power; and whether the intermediate state of created spirits be not that alone which is capable of both active and passive power, may be worth consideration. I shall not now enter into that inquiry, my present business being not to search into the original of power, but how we come by the IDEA of it. But since active powers make so great a part of our complex ideas of natural substances, (as we shall see hereafter,) and I mention them as such, according to common apprehension; yet they being not, perhaps, so truly ACTIVE powers as our hasty thoughts are apt to represent them, I judge it not amiss, by this intimation, to direct our minds to the consideration of God and spirits, for the clearest idea of ACTIVE power. \\3. Power includes Relation. I confess power includes in it some kind of RELATION (a relation to action or change,) as indeed which of our ideas of what kind soever, when attentively considered, does not. For, our ideas of extension, duration, and number, do they not all contain in them a secret relation of the parts? Figure and motion have something relative in them much more visibly. And sensible qualities, as colours and smells, \u0026c. what are they but the powers of different bodies, in relation to our perception, \u0026c.? And, if considered in the things themselves, do they not depend on the bulk, figure, texture, and motion of the parts? All which include some kind of relation in them. Our idea therefore of power, I think, may well have a place amongst other SIMPLE IDEAS, and be considered as one of them; being one of those that make a principal ingredient in our complex ideas of substances, as we shall hereafter have occasion to observe. \\4. The clearest Idea of active Power had from Spirit. Of passive power all sensible things abundantly furnish us with sensible ideas, whose sensible qualities and beings we find to be in continual flux. And therefore with reason we look on them as liable still to the same change. Nor have we of ACTIVE power (which is the more proper signification of the word power) fewer instances. Since whatever change is observed, the mind must collect a power somewhere able to make that change, as well as a possibility in the thin","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:29:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XXII.—OF MIXED MODES. \\1. Mixed Modes, what. Having treated of SIMPLE MODES in the foregoing chapters, and given several instances of some of the most considerable of them, to show what they are, and how we come by them; we are now in the next place to consider those we call MIXED MODES; such are the complex ideas we mark by the names OBLIGATION, DRUNKENNESS, a LIE, \u0026c.; which consisting of several combinations of simple ideas of DIFFERENT kinds, I have called mixed modes, to distinguish them from the more simple modes, which consist only of simple ideas of the SAME kind. These mixed modes, being also such combinations of simple ideas as are not looked upon to be characteristical marks of any real beings that have a steady existence, but scattered and independent ideas put together by the mind, are thereby distinguished from the complex ideas of substances. \\2. Made by the Mind. That the mind, in respect of its simple ideas, is wholly passive, and receives them all from the existence and operations of things, such as sensation or reflection offers them, without being able to MAKE any one idea, experience shows us. But if we attentively consider these ideas I call mixed modes, we are now speaking of, we shall find their origin quite different. The mind often exercises an ACTIVE power in making these several combinations. For, it being once furnished with simple ideas, it can put them together in several compositions, and so make variety of complex ideas, without examining whether they exist so together in nature. And hence I think it is that these ideas are called NOTIONS: as they had their original, and constant existence, more in the thoughts of men, than in the reality of things; and to form such ideas, it sufficed that the mind put the parts of them together, and that they were consistent in the understanding without considering whether they had any real being: though I do not deny but several of them might be taken from observation, and the existence of several simple ideas so combined, as they are put together in the understanding. For the man who first framed the idea of HYPOCRISY, might have either taken it at first from the observation of one who made show of good qualities which he had not; or else have framed that idea in his mind without having any such pattern to fashion it by. For it is evident that, in the beginning of languages and societies of men, several of those complex ideas, which were consequent to the constitutions established amongst them, must needs have been in the minds of men before they existed anywhere else; and that many names that stood for such complex ideas were in use, and so those ideas framed, before the combinations they stood for ever existed. \\3. Sometimes got by the Explication of their Names. Indeed, now that languages are made, and abound with words standing for such combinations, an usual way of GETTING these complex ideas is, by the explication of those terms that stand for them. For, consisting of a company of simple ideas combined, they may, by words standing for those simple ideas, be represented to the mind of one who understands those words, though that complex combination of simple ideas were never offered to his mind by the real existence of things. Thus a man may come to have the idea of SACRILEGE or MURDER, by enumerating to him the simple ideas which these words stand for; without ever seeing either of them committed. \\4. The Name ties the Parts of mixed Modes into one Idea. Every mixed mode consisting of many distinct simple ideas, it seems reasonable to inquire, Whence it has its unity; and how such a precise multitude comes to make but one idea; since that combination does not always exist together in nature? To which I answer, it is plain it has its unity from an act of the mind, combining those several simple ideas together, and considering them as one complex one, consisting of those parts; and the mark of this union, or that which is looked on generally to c","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:30:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XXIII.—OF OUR COMPLEX IDEAS OF SUBSTANCES. The mind being, as I have declared, furnished with a great number of the simple ideas, conveyed in by the senses as they are found in exterior things, or by reflection on its own operations, takes notice also that a certain number of these simple ideas go constantly together; which being presumed to belong to one thing, and words being suited to common apprehensions, and made use of for quick dispatch are called, so united in one subject, by one name; which, by inadvertency, we are apt afterward to talk of and consider as one simple idea, which indeed is a complication of many ideas together: because, as I have said, not imagining how these simple ideas CAN subsist by themselves, we accustom ourselves to suppose some SUBSTRATUM wherein they do subsist, and from which they do result, which therefore we call SUBSTANCE. \\2. Our obscure Idea of Substance in general. So that if any one will examine himself concerning his notion of pure substance in general, he will find he has no other idea of it at all, but only a supposition of he knows not what SUPPORT of such qualities which are capable of producing simple ideas in us; which qualities are commonly called accidents. If any one should be asked, what is the subject wherein colour or weight inheres, he would have nothing to say, but the solid extended parts; and if he were demanded, what is it that solidity and extension adhere in, he would not be in a much better case than the Indian before mentioned who, saying that the world was supported by a great elephant, was asked what the elephant rested on; to which his answer was—a great tortoise: but being again pressed to know what gave support to the broad-backed tortoise, replied—SOMETHING, HE KNEW NOT WHAT. And thus here, as in all other cases where we use words without having clear and distinct ideas, we talk like children: who, being questioned what such a thing is, which they know not, readily give this satisfactory answer, that it is SOMETHING: which in truth signifies no more, when so used, either by children or men, but that they know not what; and that the thing they pretend to know, and talk of, is what they have no distinct idea of at all, and so are perfectly ignorant of it, and in the dark. The idea then we have, to which we give the GENERAL name substance, being nothing but the supposed, but unknown, support of those qualities we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist SINE RE SUBSTANTE, without something to support them, we call that support SUBSTANTIA; which, according to the true import of the word, is, in plain English, standing under or upholding. \\3. Of the Sorts of Substances. An obscure and relative idea of SUBSTANCE IN GENERAL being thus made we come to have the ideas of PARTICULAR SORTS OF SUBSTANCES, by collecting SUCH combinations of simple ideas as are, by experience and observation of men’s senses, taken notice of to exist together; and are therefore supposed to flow from the particular internal constitution, or unknown essence of that substance. Thus we come to have the ideas of a man, horse, gold, water, \u0026c.; of which substances, whether any one has any other CLEAR idea, further than of certain simple ideas co-existent together, I appeal to every one’s own experience. It is the ordinary qualities observable in iron, or a diamond, put together, that make the true complex idea of those substances, which a smith or a jeweller commonly knows better than a philosopher; who, whatever SUBSTANTIAL FORMS he may talk of, has no other idea of those substances, than what is framed by a collection of those simple ideas which are to be found in them: only we must take notice, that our complex ideas of substances, besides all those simple ideas they are made up of, have always the confused idea of something to which they belong, and in which they subsist: and therefore when we speak of any sort of substance, we say it is a thing having such or such qualities; as ","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:31:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XXIV.—OF COLLECTIVE IDEAS OF SUBSTANCES. \\1. A collective idea is one Idea. Besides these complex ideas of several SINGLE substances, as of man, horse, gold, violet, apple, \u0026c., the mind hath also complex COLLECTIVE ideas of substances; which I so call, because such ideas are made up of many particular substances considered together, as united into one idea, and which so joined; are looked on as one; v. g. the idea of such a collection of men as make an ARMY, though consisting of a great number of distinct substances, is as much one idea as the idea of a man: and the great collective idea of all bodies whatsoever, signified by the name WORLD, is as much one idea as the idea of any the least particle of matter in it; it sufficing to the unity of any idea, that it be considered as one representation or picture, though made up of ever so many particulars. \\2. Made by the Power of composing in the Mind. These collective ideas of substances the mind makes, by its power of composition, and uniting severally either simple or complex ideas into one, as it does, by the same faculty, make the complex ideas of particular substances, consisting of an aggregate of divers simple ideas, united in one substance. And as the mind, by putting together the repeated ideas of unity, makes the collective mode, or complex idea, of any number, as a score, or a gross, \u0026c.,—so, by putting together several particular substances, it makes collective ideas of substances, as a troop, an army, a swarm, a city, a fleet; each of which every one finds that he represents to his own mind by one idea, in one view; and so under that notion considers those several things as perfectly one, as one ship, or one atom. Nor is it harder to conceive how an army of ten thousand men should make one idea than how a man should make one idea it being as easy to the mind to unite into one the idea of a great number of men, and consider it as one as it is to unite into one particular all the distinct ideas that make up the composition of a man, and consider them all together as one. \\3. Artificial things that are made up of distinct substances are our collective Ideas. Amongst such kind of collective ideas are to be counted most part of artificial things, at least such of them as are made up of distinct substances: and, in truth, if we consider all these collective ideas aright, as ARMY, CONSTELLATION, UNIVERSE, as they are united into so many single ideas, they are but the artificial draughts of the mind; bringing things very remote, and independent on one another, into one view, the better to contemplate and discourse on them, united into one conception, and signified by one name. For there are no things so remote, nor so contrary, which the mind cannot, by this art of composition, bring into one idea; as is visible in that signified by the name UNIVERSE.

Relation, what. BESIDES the ideas, whether simple or complex, that the mind has of things as they are in themselves, there are others it gets from their comparison one with another. The understanding, in the consideration of anything, is not confined to that precise object: it can carry any idea as it were beyond itself, or at least look beyond it, to see how it stands in conformity to any other. When the mind so considers one thing, that it does as it were bring it to, and set it by another, and carries its view from one to the other—this is, as the words import, RELATION and RESPECT; and the denominations given to positive things, intimating that respect, and serving as marks to lead the thoughts beyond the subject itself denominated, to something distinct from it, are what we call RELATIVES; and the things so brought together, RELATED. Thus, when the mind considers Caius as such a positive being, it takes nothing into that idea but what really exists in Caius; v.g. when I consider him as a man, I have nothing in my mind but the complex idea of the species, man. So likewise, when I say Caius is a white man, I have nothing but the bare consideration of a man who hath that white colour. But when I give Caius the name HUSBAND, I intimate some other person; and when I give him the name WHITER, I intimate some other thing: in both cases my thought is led to something beyond Caius, and there are two things brought into consideration. And since any idea, whether simple or complex, may be the occasion why the mind thus brings two things together, and as it were takes a view of them at once, though still considered as distinct: therefore any of our ideas may be the foundation of relation. As in the above-mentioned instance, the contract and ceremony of marriage with Sempronia is the occasion of the denomination and relation of husband; and the colour white the occasion why he is said to be whiter than free-stone. \\2. Ideas of relations without correlative Terms, not easily apprehended. These and the like relations, expressed by relative terms that have others answering them, with a reciprocal intimation, as father and son, bigger and less, cause and effect, are very obvious to every one, and everybody at first sight perceives the relation. For father and son, husband and wife, and such other correlative terms, seem so nearly to belong one to another, and, through custom, do so readily chime and answer one another in people’s memories, that, upon the naming of either of them, the thoughts are presently carried beyond the thing so named; and nobody overlooks or doubts of a relation, where it is so plainly intimated. But where languages have failed to give correlative names, there the relation is not always so easily taken notice of. CONCUBINE is, no doubt, a relative name, as well as wife: but in languages where this and the like words have not a correlative term, there people are not so apt to take them to be so, as wanting that evident mark of relation which is between correlatives, which seem to explain one another, and not to be able to exist, but together. Hence it is, that many of those names, which, duly considered, do include evident relations, have been called EXTERNAL DENOMINATIONS. But all names that are more than empty sounds must signify some idea, which is either in the thing to which the name is applied, and then it is positive, and is looked on as united to and existing in the thing to which the denomination is given; or else it arises from the respect the mind finds in it to something distinct from it, with which it considers it, and then it includes a relation. \\3. Some seemingly absolute Terms contain Relations. Another sort of relative terms there is, which are not looked on to be either relative, or so much as external denominations: which yet, under the form and appearance of signifying something absolute in the subject, do conceal a tacit, though less observable, relation. Such are t","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:33:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XXVI.—OF CAUSE AND EFFECT, AND OTHER RELATIONS. \\1. Whence the Ideas of cause and effect got. In the notice that our senses take of the constant vicissitude of things, we cannot but observe that several particular, both qualities and substances, begin to exist; and that they receive this their existence from the due application and operation of some other being. From this observation we get our ideas of CAUSE and EFFECT. THAT WHICH PRODUCES ANY SIMPLE OR COMPLEX IDEA we denote by the general name, CAUSE, and THAT WHICH IS PRODUCED, EFFECT. Thus, finding that in that substance which we call wax, fluidity, which is a simple idea that was not in it before, is constantly produced by the application of a certain degree of heat we call the simple idea of heat, in relation to fluidity in wax, the cause of it, and fluidity the effect. So also, finding that the substance, wood, which is a certain collection of simple ideas so called, by the application of fire, is turned into another substance, called ashes; i. e., another complex idea, consisting of a collection of simple ideas, quite different from that complex idea which we call wood; we consider fire, in relation to ashes, as cause, and the ashes, as effect. So that whatever is considered by us to conduce or operate to the producing any particular simple idea, or collection of simple ideas, whether substance or mode, which did not before exist, hath thereby in our minds the relation of a cause, and so is denominated by us. \\2. Creation Generation, making Alteration. Having thus, from what our senses are able to discover in the operations of bodies on one another, got the notion of cause and effect, viz. that a cause is that which makes any other thing, either simple idea, substance, or mode, begin to be; and an effect is that which had its beginning from some other thing; the mind finds no great difficulty to distinguish the several originals of things into two sorts:— First, When the thing is wholly made new, so that no part thereof did ever exist before; as when a new particle of matter doth begin to exist, IN RERUM NATURA, which had before no being, and this we call CREATION. Secondly, When a thing is made up of particles, which did all of them before exist; but that very thing, so constituted of pre-existing particles, which, considered all together, make up such a collection of simple ideas, had not any existence before, as this man, this egg, rose, or cherry, \u0026c. And this, when referred to a substance, produced in the ordinary course of nature by internal principle, but set on work by, and received from, some external agent, or cause, and working by insensible ways which we perceive not, we call GENERATION. When the cause is extrinsical, and the effect produced by a sensible separation, or juxta-position of discernible parts, we call it MAKING; and such are all artificial things. When any simple idea is produced, which was not in that subject before, we call it ALTERATION. Thus a man is generated, a picture made; and either of them altered, when any new sensible quality or simple idea is produced in either of them, which was not there before: and the things thus made to exist, which were not there before, are effects; and those things which operated to the existence, causes. In which, and all other cases, we may observe, that the notion of cause and effect has its rise from ideas received by sensation or reflection; and that this relation, how comprehensive soever, terminates at last in them. For to have the idea of cause and effect, it suffices to consider any simple idea or substance, as beginning to exist, by the operation of some other, without knowing the manner of that operation. \\3. Relations of Time. Time and place are also the foundations of very large relations; and all finite beings at least are concerned in them. But having already shown in another place how we get those ideas, it may suffice here to intimate, that most of the denominations of things recei","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:34:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XXVII.—OF IDENTITY AND DIVERSITY. \\1. Wherein Identity consists. ANOTHER occasion the mind often takes of comparing, is the very being of things, when, considering ANYTHING AS EXISTING AT ANY DETERMINED TIME AND PLACE, we compare it with ITSELF EXISTING AT ANOTHER TIME, and thereon form the ideas of IDENTITY and DIVERSITY. When we see anything to be in any place in any instant of time, we are sure (be it what it will) that it is that very thing, and not another which at that same time exists in another place, how like and undistinguishable soever it may be in all other respects: and in this consists IDENTITY, when the ideas it is attributed to vary not at all from what they were that moment wherein we consider their former existence, and to which we compare the present. For we never finding, nor conceiving it possible, that two things of the same kind should exist in the same place at the same time, we rightly conclude, that, whatever exists anywhere at any time, excludes all of the same kind, and is there itself alone. When therefore we demand whether anything be the SAME or no, it refers always to something that existed such a time in such a place, which it was certain, at that instant, was the same with itself, and no other. From whence it follows, that one thing cannot have two beginnings of existence, nor two things one beginning; it being impossible for two things of the same kind to be or exist in the same instant, in the very same place; or one and the same thing in different places. That, therefore, that had one beginning, is the same thing; and that which had a different beginning in time and place from that, is not the same, but diverse. That which has made the difficulty about this relation has been the little care and attention used in having precise notions of the things to which it is attributed. \\2. Identity of Substances. We have the ideas but of three sorts of substances: 1. GOD. 2. FINITE INTELLIGENCES. 3. BODIES. First, GOD is without beginning, eternal, unalterable, and everywhere, and therefore concerning his identity there can be no doubt. Secondly, FINITE SPIRITS having had each its determinated time and place of beginning to exist, the relation to that time and place will always determine to each of them its identity, as long as it exists. Thirdly, The same will hold of every PARTICLE OF MATTER, to which no addition or subtraction of matter being made, it is the same. For, though these three sorts of substances, as we term them, do not exclude one another out of the same place, yet we cannot conceive but that they must necessarily each of them exclude any of the same kind out of the same place: or else the notions and names of identity and diversity would be in vain, and there could be no such distinctions of substances, or anything else one from another. For example: could two bodies be in the same place at the same time; then those two parcels of matter must be one and the same, take them great or little; nay, all bodies must be one and the same. For, by the same reason that two particles of matter may be in one place, all bodies may be in one place: which, when it can be supposed, takes away the distinction of identity and diversity of one and more, and renders it ridiculous. But it being a contradiction that two or more should be one, identity and diversity are relations and ways of comparing well founded, and of use to the understanding. \\3. Identity of modes and relations. All other things being but modes or relations ultimately terminated in substances, the identity and diversity of each particular existence of them too will be by the same way determined: only as to things whose existence is in succession, such as are the actions of finite beings, v. g. MOTION and THOUGHT, both which consist in a continued train of succession, concerning THEIR diversity there can be no question: because each perishing the moment it begins, they cannot exist in different times, or in different places, as ","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:35:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"24. But is not a man drunk and sober the same person? why else is he punished for the fact he commits when drunk, though he be never afterwards conscious of it? Just as much the same person as a man that walks, and does other things in his sleep, is the same person, and is answerable for any mischief he shall do in it. Human laws punish both, with a justice suitable to THEIR way of knowledge;—because, in these cases, they cannot distinguish certainly what is real, what counterfeit: and so the ignorance in drunkenness or sleep is not admitted as a plea. But in the Great Day, wherein the secrets of all hearts shall be laid open, it may be reasonable to think, no one shall be made to answer for what he knows nothing of; but shall receive his doom, his conscience accusing or excusing him. \\25. Consciousness alone unites remote existences into one Person. Nothing but consciousness can unite remote existences into the same person: the identity of substance will not do it; for whatever substance there is, however framed, without consciousness there is no person: and a carcass may be a person, as well as any sort of substance be so, without consciousness. Could we suppose two distinct incommunicable consciousnesses acting the same body, the one constantly by day, the other by night; and, on the other side, the same consciousness, acting by intervals, two distinct bodies: I ask, in the first case, whether the day and the night—man would not be two as distinct persons as Socrates and Plato? And whether, in the second case, there would not be one person in two distinct bodies, as much as one man is the same in two distinct clothings? Nor is it at all material to say, that this same, and this distinct consciousness, in the cases above mentioned, is owing to the same and distinct immaterial substances, bringing it with them to those bodies; which, whether true or no, alters not the case: since it is evident the personal identity would equally be determined by the consciousness, whether that consciousness were annexed to some individual immaterial substance or no. For, granting that the thinking substance in man must be necessarily supposed immaterial, it is evident that immaterial thinking thing may sometimes part with its past consciousness, and be restored to it again: as appears in the forgetfulness men often have of their past actions; and the mind many times recovers the memory of a past consciousness, which it had lost for twenty years together. Make these intervals of memory and forgetfulness to take their turns regularly by day and night, and you have two persons with the same immaterial spirit, as much as in the former instance two persons with the same body. So that self is not determined by identity or diversity of substance, which it cannot be sure of, but only by identity of consciousness. \\26. Not the substance with which the consciousness may be united. Indeed it may conceive the substance whereof it is now made up to have existed formerly, united in the same conscious being: but, consciousness removed, that substance is no more itself, or makes no more a part of it, than any other substance; as is evident in the instance we have already given of a limb cut off, of whose heat, or cold, or other affections, having no longer any consciousness, it is no more of a man’s self than any other matter of the universe. In like manner it will be in reference to any immaterial substance, which is void of that consciousness whereby I am myself to myself: so that I cannot upon recollection join with that present consciousness whereby I am now myself, it is, in that part of its existence, no more MYSELF than any other immaterial being. For, whatsoever any substance has thought or done, which I cannot recollect, and by my consciousness make my own thought and action, it will no more belong to me, whether a part of me thought or did it, than if it had been thought or done by any other immaterial being anywhere existing. \\27.

Ideas of Proportional relations. BESIDES the before-mentioned occasions of time, place, and causality of comparing or referring things one to another, there are, as I have said, infinite others, some whereof I shall mention. First, The first I shall name is some one simple idea, which, being capable of parts or degrees, affords an occasion of comparing the subjects wherein it is to one another, in respect of that simple idea, v.g. whiter, sweeter, equal, more, \u0026c. These relations depending on the equality and excess of the same simple idea, in several subjects, may be called, if one will, PROPORTIONAL; and that these are only conversant about those simple ideas received from sensation or reflection is so evident that nothing need be said to evince it. \\2. Natural relation. Secondly, Another occasion of comparing things together, or considering one thing, so as to include in that consideration some other thing, is the circumstances of their origin or beginning; which being not afterwards to be altered, make the relations depending thereon as lasting as the subjects to which they belong, v.g. father and son, brothers, cousin-germans, \u0026c., which have their relations by one community of blood, wherein they partake in several degrees: countrymen, i.e. those who were born in the same country or tract of ground; and these I call NATURAL RELATIONS: wherein we may observe, that mankind have fitted their notions and words to the use of common life, and not to the truth and extent of things. For it is certain, that, in reality, the relation is the same betwixt the begetter and the begotten, in the several races of other animals as well as men; but yet it is seldom said, this bull is the grandfather of such a calf, or that two pigeons are cousin-germans. It is very convenient that, by distinct names, these relations should be observed and marked out in mankind, there being occasion, both in laws and other communications one with another, to mention and take notice of men under these relations: from whence also arise the obligations of several duties amongst men: whereas, in brutes, men having very little or no cause to mind these relations, they have not thought fit to give them distinct and peculiar names. This, by the way, may give us some light into the different state and growth of languages; which being suited only to the convenience of communication, are proportioned to the notions men have, and the commerce of thoughts familiar amongst them; and not to the reality or extent of things, nor to the various respects might be found among them; nor the different abstract considerations might be framed about them. Where they had no philosophical notions, there they had no terms to express them: and it is no wonder men should have framed no names for those things they found no occasion to discourse of. From whence it is easy to imagine why, as in some countries, they may have not so much as the name for a horse; and in others, where they are more careful of the pedigrees of their horses, than of their own, that there they may have not only names for particular horses, but also of their several relations of kindred one to another. \\3. Ideas of Instituted or Voluntary relations. Thirdly, Sometimes the foundation of considering things with reference to one another, is some act whereby any one comes by a moral right, power, or obligation to do something. Thus, a general is one that hath power to command an army, and an army under a general is a collection of armed men obliged to obey one man. A citizen, or a burgher, is one who has a right to certain privileges in this or that place, All this sort depending upon men’s wills, or agreement in society, I call INSTITUTED, or VOLUNTARY; and may be distinguished from the natural, in that they are most, if not all of them, some way or other alterable, and separable from the persons to whom they have sometimes belonged, though neither of the substances, so relat","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:36:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XXIX.—OF CLEAR AND OBSCURE, DISTINCT AND CONFUSED IDEAS. \\1. Ideas, some clear and distinct, others obscure and confused. Having shown the original of our ideas, and taken a view of their several sorts; considered the difference between the simple and the complex; and observed how the complex ones are divided into those of modes, substances, and relations—all which, I think, is necessary to be done by any one who would acquaint himself thoroughly with the progress of the mind, in its apprehension and knowledge of things—it will, perhaps, be thought I have dwelt long enough upon the examination of IDEAS. I must, nevertheless, crave leave to offer some few other considerations concerning them. The first is, that some are CLEAR and others OBSCURE; some DISTINCT and others CONFUSED. \\2. Clear and obscure explained by Sight. The perception of the mind being most aptly explained by words relating to the sight, we shall best understand what is meant by CLEAR and OBSCURE in our ideas, by reflecting on what we call clear and obscure in the objects of sight. Light being that which discovers to us visible objects, we give the name of OBSCURE to that which is not placed in a light sufficient to discover minutely to us the figure and colours which are observable in it, and which, in a better light, would be discernible. In like manner, our simple ideas are CLEAR, when they are such as the objects themselves from whence they were taken did or might, in a well-ordered sensation or perception, present them. Whilst the memory retains them thus, and can produce them to the mind whenever it has occasion to consider them, they are clear ideas. So far as they either want anything of the original exactness, or have lost any of their first freshness, and are, as it were, faded or tarnished by time, so far are they obscure. Complex ideas, as they are made up of simple ones, so they are clear, when the ideas that go to their composition are clear, and the number and order of those simple ideas that are the ingredients of any complex one is determinate and certain. \\3. Causes of Obscurity. The causes of obscurity, in simple ideas, seem to be either dull organs; or very slight and transient impressions made by the objects; or else a weakness in the memory, not able to retain them as received. For to return again to visible objects, to help us to apprehend this matter. If the organs, or faculties of perception, like wax over-hardened with cold, will not receive the impression of the seal, from the usual impulse wont to imprint it; or, like wax of a temper too soft, will not hold it well, when well imprinted; or else supposing the wax of a temper fit, but the seal not applied with a sufficient force to make a clear impression: in any of these cases, the print left by the seal will be obscure. This, I suppose, needs no application to make it plainer. \\4. Distinct and confused, what. As a clear idea is that whereof the mind has such a full and evident perception, as it does receive from an outward object operating duly on a well-disposed organ, so a DISTINCT idea is that wherein the mind perceives a difference from all other; and a CONFUSED idea is such an one as is not sufficiently distinguishable from another, from which it ought to be different. \\5. Objection. If no idea be confused, but such as is not sufficiently distinguishable from another from which it should be different, it will be hard, may any one say, to find anywhere a CONFUSED idea. For, let any idea be as it will, it can be no other but such as the mind perceives it to be; and that very perception sufficiently distinguishes it from all other ideas, which cannot be other, i.e. different, without being perceived to be so. No idea, therefore, can be undistinguishable from another from which it ought to be different, unless you would have it different from itself: for from all other it is evidently different. \\6. Confusion of Ideas is in Reference to their Names. To remove this difficult","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:37:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XXX.—OF REAL AND FANTASTICAL IDEAS. \\1. Ideas considered in reference to their Archetypes. Besides what we have already mentioned concerning ideas, other considerations belong to them, in reference to THINGS FROM WHENCE THEY ARE TAKEN, or WHICH THEY MAY BE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT; and thus, I think, they may come under a threefold distinction, and are:—First, either real or fantastical; Secondly, adequate or inadequate; Thirdly, true or false. First, by REAL IDEAS, I mean such as have a foundation in nature; such as have a conformity with the real being and existence of things, or with their archetypes. FANTASTICAL or CHIMERICAL, I call such as have no foundation in nature, nor have any conformity with that reality of being to which they are tacitly referred, as to their archetypes. If we examine the several sorts of ideas before mentioned, we shall find that, \\2. Simple Ideas are all real appearances of things. First, Our SIMPLE IDEAS are all real, all agree to the reality of things: not that they are all of them the images or representations of what does exist; the contrary whereof, in all but the primary qualities of bodies, hath been already shown. But, though whiteness and coldness are no more in snow than pain is; yet those ideas of whiteness and coldness, pain, \u0026c., being in us the effects of powers in things without us, ordained by our Maker to produce in us such sensations; they are real ideas in us, whereby we distinguish the qualities that are really in things themselves. For, these several appearances being designed to be the mark whereby we are to know and distinguish things which we have to do with, our ideas do as well serve us to that purpose, and are as real distinguishing characters, whether they be only CONSTANT EFFECTS, or else EXACT RESEMBLANCES of something in the things themselves: the reality lying in that steady correspondence they have with the distinct constitutions of real beings. But whether they answer to those constitutions, as to causes or patterns, it matters not; it suffices that they are constantly produced by them. And thus our simple ideas are all real and true, because they answer and agree to those powers of things which produce them on our minds; that being all that is requisite to make them real, and not fictions at pleasure. For in simple ideas (as has been shown) the mind is wholly confined to the operation of things upon it, and can make to itself no simple idea, more than what it was received. \\3. Complex Ideas are voluntary Combinations. Though the mind be wholly passive in respect of its simple ideas; yet, I think, we may say it is not so in respect of its complex ideas. For those being combinations of simple ideas put together, and united under one general name, it is plain that the mind of man uses some kind of liberty in forming those complex ideas: how else comes it to pass that one man’s idea of gold, or justice, is different from another’s, but because he has put in, or left out of his, some simple idea which the other has not? The question then is, Which of these are real, and which barely imaginary combinations? What collections agree to the reality of things, and what not? And to this I say that, \\4. Mixed Modes and Relations, made of consistent Ideas, are real. Secondly, MIXED MODES and RELATIONS, having no other reality but what they have in the minds of men, there is nothing more required to this kind of ideas to make them real, but that they be so framed, that there be a possibility of existing conformable to them. These ideas themselves, being archetypes, cannot differ from their archetypes, and so cannot be chimerical, unless any one will jumble together in them inconsistent ideas. Indeed, as any of them have the names of a known language assigned to them, by which he that has them in his mind would signify them to others, so bare possibility of existing is not enough; they must have a conformity to the ordinary signification of the name that is given them, th","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:38:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XXXI.—OF ADEQUATE AND INADEQUATE IDEAS. \\1. Adequate Ideas are such as perfectly represent their Archetypes. Of our real ideas, some are adequate, and some are inadequate. Those I call ADEQUATE, which perfectly represent those archetypes which the mind supposes them taken from: which it intends them to stand for, and to which it refers them. INADEQUATE IDEAS are such, which are but a partial or incomplete representation of those archetypes to which they are referred. Upon which account it is plain, \\2. Adequate Ideas are such as perfectly represent their Archetypes. Simple Ideas all adequate. First, that ALL OUR SIMPLE IDEAS ARE ADEQUATE. Because, being nothing but the effects of certain powers in things, fitted and ordained by God to produce such sensations in us, they cannot but be correspondent and adequate to those powers: and we are sure they agree to the reality of things. For, if sugar produce in us the ideas which we call whiteness and sweetness, we are sure there is a power in sugar to produce those ideas in our minds, or else they could not have been produced by it. And so each sensation answering the power that operates on any of our senses, the idea so produced is a real idea, (and not a fiction of the mind, which has no power to produce any simple idea); and cannot but be adequate, since it ought only to answer that power: and so all simple ideas are adequate. It is true, the things producing in us these simple ideas are but few of them denominated by us, as if they were only the CAUSES of them; but as if those ideas were real beings IN them. For, though fire be called painful to the touch, whereby is signified the power of producing in us the idea of pain, yet it is denominated also light and hot; as if light and heat were really something in the fire, more than a power to excite these ideas in us; and therefore are called qualities in or of the fire. But these being nothing, in truth, but powers to excite such ideas in us, I must in that sense be understood, when I speak of secondary qualities as being in things; or of their ideas as being the objects that excite them in us. Such ways of speaking, though accommodated to the vulgar notions, without which one cannot be well understood, yet truly signify nothing but those powers which are in things to excite certain sensations or ideas in us. Since were there no fit organs to receive the impressions fire makes on the sight and touch, nor a mind joined to those organs to receive the ideas of light and heat by those impressions from the fire or sun, there would yet be no more light or heat in the world than there would be pain if there were no sensible creature to feel it, though the sun should continue just as it is now, and Mount AEtna flame higher than ever it did. Solidity and extension, and the termination of it, figure, with motion and rest, whereof we have the ideas, would be really in the world as they are, whether there were any sensible being to perceive them or no: and therefore we have reason to look on those as the real modifications of matter, and such as are the exciting causes of all our various sensations from bodies. But this being an inquiry not belonging to this place, I shall enter no further into it, but proceed to show what complex ideas are adequate, and what not. \\3. Modes are all adequate. Secondly, OUR COMPLEX IDEAS OF MODES, being voluntary collections of simple ideas, which the mind puts together, without reference to any real archetypes, or standing patterns, existing anywhere, are and cannot but be ADEQUATE IDEAS. Because they, not being intended for copies of things really existing, but for archetypes made by the mind, to rank and denominate things by, cannot want anything; they having each of them that combination of ideas, and thereby that perfection, which the mind intended they should: so that the mind acquiesces in them, and can find nothing wanting. Thus, by having the idea of a figure with three sides meeting at three an","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:39:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XXXII.—OF TRUE AND FALSE IDEAS. \\1. Truth and Falsehood properly belong to Propositions, not to Ideas. Though truth and falsehood belong, in propriety of speech, only to PROPOSITIONS: yet IDEAS are oftentimes termed true or false (as what words are there that are not used with great latitude, and with some deviation from their strict and proper significations?) Though I think that when ideas themselves are termed true or false, there is still some secret or tacit proposition, which is the foundation of that denomination: as we shall see, if we examine the particular occasions wherein they come to be called true or false. In all which we shall find some kind of affirmation or negation, which is the reason of that denomination. For our ideas, being nothing but bare APPEARANCES, or perceptions in our minds, cannot properly and simply in themselves be said to be true or false, no more than a single name of anything can be said to be true or false. \\2. Ideas and words may be said to be true, inasmuch as they really are ideas and words. Indeed both ideas and words may be said to be true, in a metaphysical sense of the word truth; as all other things that any way exist are said to be true, i.e. really to be such as they exist. Though in things called true, even in that sense, there is perhaps a secret reference to our ideas, looked upon as the standards of that truth; which amounts to a mental proposition, though it be usually not taken notice of. \\3. No Idea, as an Appearance in the Mind, either true or false. But it is not in that metaphysical sense of truth which we inquire here, when we examine, whether our ideas are capable of being true or false, but in the more ordinary acceptation of those words: and so I say that the ideas in our minds, being only so many perceptions or appearances there, none of them are false; the idea of a centaur having no more falsehood in it when it appears in our minds, than the name centaur has falsehood in it, when it is pronounced by our mouths, or written on paper. For truth or falsehood lying always in some affirmation or negation, mental or verbal, our ideas are not capable, any of them, of being false, till the mind passes some judgment on them; that is, affirms or denies something of them. \\4. Ideas referred to anything extraneous to them may be true or false. Whenever the mind refers any of its ideas to anything extraneous to them, they are then capable to be called true or false. Because the mind, in such a reference, makes a tacit supposition of their conformity to that thing; which supposition, as it happens to be true or false, so the ideas themselves come to be denominated. The most usual cases wherein this happens, are these following: \\5. Other Men’s Ideas; real Existence; and supposed real Essences, are what Men usually refer their Ideas to. First, when the mind supposes any idea it has CONFORMABLE to that in OTHER MEN’S MINDS, called by the same common name; v.g. when the mind intends or judges its ideas of justice, temperance, religion, to be the same with what other men give those names to. Secondly, when the mind supposes any idea it has in itself to be CONFORMABLE to some REAL EXISTENCE. Thus the two ideas of a man and a centaur, supposed to be the ideas of real substances, are the one true and the other false; the one having a conformity to what has really existed, the other not. Thirdly, when the mind REFERS any of its ideas to that REAL constitution and ESSENCE of anything, whereon all its properties depend: and thus the greatest part, if not all our ideas of substances, are false. \\6. The cause of such Reference. These suppositions the mind is very apt tacitly to make concerning its own ideas. But yet, if we will examine it, we shall find it is chiefly, if not only, concerning its ABSTRACT complex ideas. For the natural tendency of the mind being towards knowledge; and finding that, if it should proceed by and dwell upon only particular things, its progress would be v","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:40:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"CHAPTER XXXIII.—OF THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS. \\1. Something unreasonable in most Men. There is scarce any one that does not observe something that seems odd to him, and is in itself really extravagant, in the opinions, reasonings, and actions of other men. The least flaw of this kind, if at all different from his own, every one is quick-sighted enough to espy in another, and will by the authority of reason forwardly condemn; though he be guilty of much greater unreasonableness in his own tenets and conduct, which he never perceives, and will very hardly, if at all, be convinced of. \\2. Not wholly from Self-love. This proceeds not wholly from self-love, though that has often a great hand in it. Men of fair minds, and not given up to the overweening of self-flattery, are frequently guilty of it; and in many cases one with amazement hears the arguings, and is astonished at the obstinacy of a worthy man, who yields not to the evidence of reason, though laid before him as clear as daylight. \\3. Not from Education. This sort of unreasonableness is usually imputed to education and prejudice, and for the most part truly enough, though that reaches not the bottom of the disease, nor shows distinctly enough whence it rises, or wherein it lies. Education is often rightly assigned for the cause, and prejudice is a good general name for the thing itself: but yet, I think, he ought to look a little further, who would trace this sort of madness to the root it springs from, and so explain it, as to show whence this flaw has its original in very sober and rational minds, and wherein it consists. \\4. A Degree of Madness found in most Men. I shall be pardoned for calling it by so harsh a name as madness, when it is considered that opposition to reason deserves that name, and is really madness; and there is scarce a man so free from it, but that if he should always, on all occasions, argue or do as in some cases he constantly does, would not be thought fitter for Bedlam than civil conversation. I do not here mean when he is under the power of an unruly passion, but in the steady calm course of his life. That which will yet more apologize for this harsh name, and ungrateful imputation on the greatest part of mankind, is, that, inquiring a little by the bye into the nature of madness, (b. ii. ch. xi., Section 13,) I found it to spring from the very same root, and to depend on the very same cause we are here speaking of. This consideration of the thing itself, at a time when I thought not I the least on the subject which I am now treating of, suggested it to me. And if this be a weakness to which all men are so liable, if this be a taint which so universally infects mankind, the greater care should be taken to lay it open under its due name, thereby to excite the greater care in its prevention and cure. \\5. From a wrong Connexion of Ideas. Some of our ideas have a NATURAL correspondence and connexion one with another: it is the office and excellency of our reason to trace these, and hold them together in that union and correspondence which is founded in their peculiar beings. Besides this, there is another connexion of ideas wholly owing to CHANCE or CUSTOM. Ideas that in themselves are not all of kin, come to be so united in some men’s minds, that it is very hard to separate them; they always keep in company, and the one no sooner at any time comes into the understanding, but its associate appears with it; and if they are more than two which are thus united, the whole gang, always inseparable, show themselves together. \\6. This Connexion made by custom. This strong combination of ideas, not allied by nature, the mind makes in itself either voluntarily or by chance; and hence it comes in different men to be very different, according to their different inclinations, education, interests, \u0026c. CUSTOM settles habits of thinking in the understanding, as well as of determining in the will, and of motions in the body: all which seems to be but trains of mot","date":"2022-07-06","objectID":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/:41:0","tags":["understanding"],"title":"An essay concerning human understanding","uri":"/en/an_essay_concerning_human_understanding/"},{"categories":["understanding"],"content":"END OF VOLUME I End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding, Volume I., by John Locke *** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HUMANE UNDERSTANDING *** ***** This file should be named 10615-h.htm or 10616-h.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in: https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/6/1/10615/ Produced by Steve Harris and David Widger Updated editions will replace the previous one–the old editions will be renamed.

Acknowledgments An intellectual commitment to social and economic justice first galvanized this book’s journey. My search to understand the massive sea changes occurring in American business practices during the past three decades took me to the doorstep of Wall Street investment banks, an unconventional site for anthropological research. This project found a champion in my graduate advisor, Emily Martin, during a time when studying centers of power within the United States was still uncharted territory for most anthropologists.

Skin in the Game —— Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life A 2018 nonfiction book by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a former options trader with a background in the mathematics of probability and statistics. 2. End of History and the Last Man A 1992 book of political philosophy by American political scientist Francis Fukuyama which argues that with the ascendancy of Western liberal democracy—which occurred after the Cold War (1945–1991) and the dissolution of the Soviet Union (1991)—humanity has reached “not just … the passing of a particular period of post-war history, but the end of history as such: That is, the end-point of mankind’s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.” —— from Wikipedia 3. The Discovery of Society This classic text explores the lives and ideas of the social thinkers who have shaped and continue to forge traditions in sociology. Focusing on the great names in the field, it weaves biographical and conceptual details into a tapestry of the history of social thought of the 19th and 20th centuries. Written in a narrative style that is accessible and exciting, this text serves as an excellent supplement for courses in social and sociological theory, the history of social thought, the history of sociology, and introduction to sociology. 4. A Treatise of Human Nature Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects (1739–40) is a book by Scottish philosopher David Hume, considered by many to be Hume’s most important work and one of the most influential works in the history of philosophy.[1] The Treatise is a classic statement of philosophical empiricism, scepticism, and naturalism. In the introduction Hume presents the idea of placing all science and philosophy on a novel foundation: namely, an empirical investigation into human nature. Impressed by Isaac Newton’s achievements in the physical sciences, Hume sought to introduce the same experimental method of reasoning into the study of human psychology, with the aim of discovering the “extent and force of human understanding”. 5. An Essay Concerning Human Understanding An Essay Concerning Human Understanding is a work by John Locke concerning the foundation of human knowledge and understanding. It first appeared in 1689 (although dated 1690) with the printed title An Essay Concerning Human Understanding. He describes the mind at birth as a blank slate (tabula rasa, although he did not use those actual words) filled later through experience. The essay was one of the principal sources of empiricism in modern philosophy, and influenced many enlightenment philosophers, such as David Hume and George Berkeley. 6. The Economist The Economist is a British weekly newspaper printed in demitab format and published digitally that focuses on current affairs, international business, politics, technology, and culture. Based in London, the newspaper is owned by The Economist Group, with core editorial offices in the United States, as well as across major cities in continental Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.

The housing market’s epic boom early this decade has turned into an epic bust whose effects may take years to shake off. How we got into this predicament, and whether what is currently being done in Washington is likely to make things better or worse, is the subject of this book. Usually a revised edition of a book is an occasion for correcting some of the things that were said in the first edition. In this case, however, both the analyses and the inferences in the first edition have since turned out to be painfully accurate, so this new edition will primarily update the economic situation, bringing out new facts that have become available since the first edition last year, and analyzing misguided new policies, promoted by politicians of both parties. Perhaps, instead of a revised edition, this might more aptly be called a “reinforced” edition. The finger-pointing that almost invariably follows in the wake of any disaster—economic or otherwise—has generated much political rhetoric and spin, much of it repeated in the media and some of it in academia. What is crucial is to separate the facts from the rhetoric, so as to understand what got us where we are. Otherwise, we may needlessly extend or even repeat a national trauma that is hard enough to get through just one time. How complicated is the problem? The economics of the housing boom and bust are pretty straightforward. The politics of it include a lot of misleading statements, but these can be broken down with the help of facts—and the more facts we look at, the more the rhetoric clears away, like fog evaporating in the sunlight. We may sometimes become disgusted at what we learn when we look at facts, but at least we are no longer confused by political spin. The great Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes deplored “phrases that serve as an excuse for not thinking” and said, “think things not words.” This book will look at things, and try to cut through the words that obscure them.

Moreover, this is a worldwide financial crisis. Financial institutions on both sides of the Atlantic have either collapsed or have been saved from collapse by government bailouts, as a result of buying securities based on American housing values that eroded or evaporated. This financial tsunami has been followed by a political flood of rhetoric, accompanied by finger-pointing in all directions. Who was really responsible? What set this off? There was no single, dramatic event that set this off, the way the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand set off the chain of events that led to the First World War or the way the arrest of political operatives committing burglary at the Watergate Hotel led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. A whole series of very questionable decisions by many people, in many places, over a period of years, built up the pressures that led to a sudden collapse of the housing market and of financial institutions that began to fall like dominoes as a result of investing in securities based on housing prices. This book is designed to unravel the tangled threads of that story. It also attempts to determine whether what is being done to deal with the problem is more likely to make things better or worse.

Frenzied might be a better term; and as the boom became a bubble, out of control would be even more appropriate. —— Mark Zandi Few markets have had such a skyrocketing rise, followed immediately by an equally steep plummet to new depths, as the housing market has had in the early years of the twenty-first century. From 2000 to 2005, the median sales price of American single-family homes rose by more than 50 percent, from $143,600 to $219,600. In some places, the rise was even sharper. Over those same years, the median home price in New York rose 79 percent, in Los Angeles 110 percent and in San Diego 127 percent. In coastal California, the rise was especially sharp—and so was the later fall. Who or what caused the housing boom and bust? There was no single cause of the housing crisis, and there is certainly plenty of blame to go around, especially among Washington politicians of both parties, who have been strenuously looking for villains outside of Washington. During the housing boom there were some voices of sanity that warned against the risky way things were being done, both in Washington and in Wall Street. However, during that boom, warnings were brushed aside with clever phrases or with pious statements about the benefits of increased home ownership. When trying to get at the causes of any major social phenomenon, we are likely to find that these causes range across a wide spectrum. The causes of the housing boom and bust have been as general as the flaws and shortcomings of human beings and as specific as the effects of Federal Reserve System policy on interest rates or a change in mortgage loan eligibility standards by the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). The housing market is greatly affected by interest rates and credit eligibility rules, but there is much more to the story than that. The record-breaking housing price rises that preceded the record-breaking housing market collapse were not evenly spread across the United States but were heavily concentrated in a relatively few places. Much confusion between local trends and national trends in housing markets contributed to counterproductive government policies. We need to understand what led to both kinds of home price trends during the boom before examining the causes and consequences of the housing bust—and the repercussions that spread, not only across the nation but internationally.

While the individual home buyer may deal solely with a bank that provides the money to buy the house, in exchange for a mortgage to be paid off in monthly installments, behind that bank and over that bank are all sorts of other institutions, whose actions affect or control the housing markets. Among the government agencies regulating various aspects of banking is the Federal Reserve System, which also has powers to take actions which affect interest rates and the money supply. Given the great importance of the level of interest rates in the home mortgage markets, the Federal Reserve is a major player in that market, even though that is just one of the markets in which its influence is felt. The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) are two government-created, but privately owned, profit-making enterprises that buy mortgages from banks. By selling these mortgages, banks get money from a 30-year mortgage without having to wait 30 years for monthly payments from home buyers to pay off their debts. With the proceeds from these sales to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or to other financial institutions, the banks then have money to lend again to create more mortgages from which to profit. More than two-thirds of the mortgages made in 2004, for example, were resold to some other financial institution, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These two government-sponsored enterprises bought more than one-third of all the mortgages in the nation that were resold by the original lenders. In order to qualify to sell their mortgages to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, banks must conform to the rules and standards prescribed by these mortgage market giants, including rules and standards that banks must in turn apply to people who seek loans to buy houses. One of the consequences, however, of reselling mortgages on a large scale is that the initial lender has fewer incentives to be meticulous about the financial qualifications of the people to whom mortgage loans are made. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is another major institution in the housing market. HUD exercises authority over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and therefore indirectly over banks and home buyers, as well as directly influencing mortgage lending practices. Other important players—and relatively new players in recent years—are Wall Street firms which buy mortgages, bundle thousands of them together and issue securities based on the value of the anticipated income from monthly mortgage payments. Wall Street firms have sold these bundles to investors across the country and around the world. These and other organizations affecting the housing market are very different from one another and are responsible to very different constituencies. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is a Cabinet-level agency directly responsible to whatever administration is in power in Washington. Although the Federal Reserve System is also a government agency, it is led by a board whose members’ staggered terms in office overlap different administrations, in order to make them independent of any particular administration. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are responsible to their stockholders, as Wall Street firms are. But Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are also what are called “government-sponsored enterprises”—meaning that they were created by the federal government, which has some continuing involvement in their policies. More important, that government involvement leads other financial institutions to lend to these two hybrid institutions at lower interest rates than they would to completely private enterprises, because of the implicit assumption that, in the event of a crisis, the federal government would not let Fannie M","date":"2022-03-06","objectID":"/en/the_housing_boom_and_bust/:3:1","tags":["房地产","real estate","boom","Thomas Sowell"],"title":"The Housing Boom and Bust","uri":"/en/the_housing_boom_and_bust/"},{"categories":["房地产"],"content":"THE COST OF HOUSING Housing is special in a number of ways. It is special to homeowners, for most of whom their house is their largest financial asset and, at the same time, their greatest financial liability. Census data show that home equity—the value of the home, over and above what is owed on the mortgage—is by far the largest single asset in the average household, accounting for 42 percent of the household’s total net worth. Meanwhile, a study by the Federal Reserve System found that mortgage debt was 82 percent of the total debt of homeowners. Whether people are buying or renting, monthly housing costs are often also the largest single item in their current budgets. In some places with especially high housing prices, such as parts of coastal California, either rent or monthly mortgage payments have taken one-half of the average person’s income. An extreme example is Salinas, California, where the monthly mortgage payment on a median priced house has taken 60 percent of new home buyers’ median income. That of course severely limits what kind of standard of living home buyers can afford with what is left. Interest Rates Housing is also special because a house is something that can seldom be bought and paid for immediately in cash. Because borrowed money is what usually pays for houses, the interest rate on that borrowed money is crucial—and that interest rate varies greatly with circumstances in the economy as a whole, in addition to varying considerably over time and from one borrower to another. While some factors affect housing prices in local areas, other factors operate nationwide. Interest rates are set nationwide by the Federal Reserve System, through the interest rate it charges to lenders, who in turn lend to the general public, including people buying homes. The interest rate on a conventional 30-year mortgage was about 8 percent in 1973, 18 percent in 1981 and 6 percent in 2005. At any given time, the interest rate also varies from person to person, depending on the financial condition and credit record of each individual. Those individuals whose credit ratings are below par may be denied loans at the prevailing interest rates, but granted “subprime” loans, which charge higher interest rates to offset the greater risk of lending to people who have lower incomes or a history of credit problems. In general, not only are people with lower credit scores charged higher interest rates for mortgage loans, people charged higher interest have higher rates of late payments, defaults or foreclosures, suggesting that the market has accurately assessed the risks. All this means that the cost of buying a given house can vary greatly with the times, with the individual and with the various “creative”—and risky—ways of trying to make the monthly mortgage payments affordable, especially in markets with high home prices. Just a difference of a percentage point or two can significantly change the cost of buying a home. When buying a house by taking out a 30-year mortgage for $400,000 the monthly payment will be less than $2,200 when the interest rate is 5 percent, but more than $2,600 when the interest rate is 7 percent. That is a difference of more than $5,000 a year. Another way of saying the same thing is that a monthly mortgage payment that would cover the cost of a 30-year mortgage for $400,000 when the interest rate is 7 percent would cover a 30-year mortgage of nearly $500,000 when the interest rate is 5 percent. In short, declining interest rates not only enable more people to be able to afford to buy a house, they enable the same person to buy a more expensive house without a higher monthly mortgage payment. In both cases, lower interest rates increase the demand for housing and thereby drive up home prices. During the early years of the twenty-first century, the interest rates that the Federal Reserve System charged financial institutions were brought down to extremely low levels.

The national and even international market for local mortgages has meant that the repercussions of housing crises in various localities can spread far beyond those localities. Moreover, a confusion between the local and the nationwide availability of “affordable housing” has contributed to government policies that led to the boom and bust. To understand all this, we need to start at square one, the scattered localities around the country where housing prices have been some multiple of the national average, and were rising much faster than the national average, during the housing boom. California—and especially coastal California—has been the largest of these exceptionally expensive housing markets. It has also been the most expensive and with the fastest rising home prices. At the height of the housing boom in 2005, the top ten areas with the biggest home price increases over the previous five years were all in California. Yet California home prices were once very similar to home prices in the rest of the nation. It was only after the decade of the 1970s that home prices in much of coastal California became far higher than home prices in the country as a whole. In the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, the median-priced home in 2005 cost more than three times the national average. In the city of San Francisco, the median home sales price that year was $765,000. In March of the same year, home prices in San Mateo County (adjacent to San Francisco) rose at a rate of $2,000 a day and later peaked at just over one million dollars in 2007. This price was paid for homes averaging less than 2,000 square feet. San Mateo was by no means unique among California communities in having modest-sized houses that were selling for what would be charged for large luxury homes elsewhere. For the state as a whole, including its interior valleys where housing prices were lower, the median sales price of homes peaked at $561,000 in 2006, when the median size of the houses sold was 1,600 square feet. Most Californians were not living in mansions, but many were paying what would be mansion prices, in some other places, for modest middle class homes. Although the housing boom and bust is a national problem in terms of its repercussions, its origins tended to be concentrated in particular places with unusually high housing prices and unusually volatile changes in those prices. For example, while home prices rose 13 percent nationwide in a single year, from 2004 to 2005, the range was from a 4 percent rise in Michigan to a 35 percent rise in Arizona. As already noted, California housing prices have long been some multiple of prices in the country as a whole. What is different about such places? Certainly the cost of building a house does not vary anywhere nearly as drastically as the prices of houses in different places. Nor does the quality of the houses vary that much between the high-priced states and the lower-priced states. Although San Francisco has some of the highest home prices and apartment rents in the country, the houses are often rather modest and built close together. As for apartments, the San Francisco Chronicle reported a graduate student looking for a place to rent in San Francisco, who was “visiting one exorbitantly priced hovel after another.” Conceivably, rising incomes or rising populations might explain why some places have higher or faster rising housing prices than others. But, in fact, incomes were rising less in California than in the rest of the country during the decade of the 1970s, when California housing prices became a multiple of the national average. Nor have population increases usually been what has driven home prices up in some places so much faster than the national ave","date":"2022-03-06","objectID":"/en/the_housing_boom_and_bust/:3:3","tags":["房地产","real estate","boom","Thomas Sowell"],"title":"The Housing Boom and Bust","uri":"/en/the_housing_boom_and_bust/"},{"categories":["媒体","media"],"content":"Part Ｉ ","date":"2022-03-06","objectID":"/en/understanding_media/:1:0","tags":["媒体","media"],"title":"Understanding Media: The Extension","uri":"/en/understanding_media/"},{"categories":["媒体","media"],"content":"INTRODUCTION James Reston wrote in The New York Times (July 7, 1957): A health director . . . reported this week that a small mouse, which presumably had been watching television, attacked a little girl and her full-grown cat. . . . Both mouse and cat survived, and the incident is recorded here as a reminder that things seem to be changing. After three thousand years of explosion, by means of fragmentary and mechanical technologies, the Western world is imploding. During the mechanical ages we had extended our bodies in space. Today, after more than a century of electric technology, we have extended our central nervous system itself in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time as far as our planet is concerned. Rapidly, we approach the final phase of the extensions of man– the technological simulation of consciousness, when the creative process of knowing will be collectively and corporately extended to the whole of human society, much as we have already extended our senses and our nerves by the various media Whether the extension of consciousness, so long sought by advertisers for specific products, will be “a good thing” is a question that admits of a wide solution. There is little possibility of answering such questions about the extensions of man without considering all of them together. Any extension, whether of skin, hand, or foot, affects the whole psychic and social complex. Some of the principal extensions, together with some of their psychic and social consequences, are studied in this book. Just how little consideration has been given to such matters in the past can be gathered from the consternation of one of the editors of this book. He noted in dismay that “seventy-five per cent of your material is new. A successful book cannot venture to be more than ten per cent new.” Such a risk seems quite worth taking at the present time when the stakes are very high, and the need to understand the effects of the extensions of man becomes more urgent by the hour. In the mechanical age now receding, many actions could be taken without too much concern. Slow movement insured that the reactions were delayed for considerable periods of time. Today the action and the reaction occur almost at the same time. We actually live mythically and integrally, as it were, but we continue to think in the old, fragmented space and time patterns of the pre-electric age. Western man acquired from the technology of literacy the power to act without reacting. The advantages of fragmenting himself in this way are seen in the case of the surgeon who would be quite helpless if he were to become humanly involved us in the whole of mankind and to incorporate with in his operation. We acquired the art of carrying out the most dangerous social operations with complete detachment. But our detachment was a posture of noninvolvement. In the electric age, when our central nervous system is technologically extended to whole of mankind and to incorporate the whole of mankind in us, we necessarily participate, in depth, in the consequences of our every action. It is no longer possible to adopt the aloof and dissociated role of the literate Westerner. The Theater of the Absurd dramatizes this recent dilemma of Western man, the man of action who appears not to be involved in the action. Such is the origin and appeal of Samuel Beckett’s clowns. After three thousand years of specialist explosion and of increasing specialism and alienation in the technological extensions of our bodies, our world has become compressional by dramatic reversal. As electrically contracted, the globe is no more than a village. Electric speed in bringing all social and political functions together in a sudden implosion has heightened human awareness of responsibility to an intense degree. It is this implo-sive factor that alters the position of the Negro, the teen-ager, and some other groups. They can no longer be contained, in the political sense of limited association.

This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium– that is, of any extension of ourselves – result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology. Thus, with automation, for example, the new patterns of human association tend to eliminate jobs, it is true. That is the negative result. Positively, automation creates roles for people, which is to say depth of involvement in their work and human association that our preceding mechanical technology had destroyed. Many people would be disposed to say that it was not the machine, but what one did with the machine, that was its meaning or message. In terms of the ways in which the machine altered our relations to one another and to ourselves, it mattered not in the least whether it turned out cornflakes or Cadillacs. The restructuring of human work and association was shaped by the technique of fragmentation that is the essence of machine technology. The essence of automation technology is the opposite. It is integral and decentralist in depth, just as the machine was fragmentary, centralist, and superficial in its patterning of human relationships. The instance of the electric light may prove illuminating in this connection. The electric light is pure information. It is a medium without a message, as it were, unless it is used to spell out some verbal ad or name. This fact, characteristic of all media, means that the “content” of any medium is always another medium. The content of writing is speech, just as the written word is the content of print, and print is the content of the telegraph. If it is asked, “What is the content of speech?,” it is necessary to say, “It is an actual process of thought, which is in itself nonverbal.” An abstract painting represents direct manifestation of creative thought processes as they might appear in computer designs. What we are considering here, however, are the psychic and social consequences of the designs or patterns as they amplify or accelerate existing processes. For the “message” of any medium or technology is the change of scale or pace or pattern that it introduces into human affairs. The railway did not introduce movement or transportation or wheel or road into human society, but it accelerated and enlarged the scale of previous human functions, creating totally new kinds of cities and new kinds of work and leisure. This happened whether the railway functioned in a tropical or a northern environment and is quite independent of the freight or content of the railway medium. The airplane, on the other hand, by accelerating the rate of transportation, tends to dissolve the railway form of city, politics, and association, quite independently of what the airplane is used for. Let us return to the electric light. When the light is being used for brain surgery or night baseball is a matter of indifference. It could be argued that these activities are in some way the “content” of the electric light, since they could not exist without the electric light. This fact merely underlines the point that “the medium is the message” because it is the medium that shapes and controls the scale and form of human association and action. The content or uses of such media are as diverse as they are ineffectual in shaping the form of human association. Indeed, it is only too typical that the “content” of any medium blinds us to the character of the medium. It is only today that industries have become aware of the various kinds of business in which they are engaged. When IBM discovered that it was not in the business of making office equipment or business machines, but that it was in the business of processing information, then it b","date":"2022-03-06","objectID":"/en/understanding_media/:1:2","tags":["媒体","media"],"title":"Understanding Media: The Extension","uri":"/en/understanding_media/"},{"categories":["媒体","media"],"content":"2 Media Cold and Hot “The rise of the waltz,” explained Curt Sachs in the World History of the Dance, “was a result of that longing for truth, simplicity, closeness to nature, and primitivism, which the last two-thirds of the eighteenth century fulfilled.” In the century of jazz we are likely to overlook the emergence of the waltz as a hot and explosive human expression that broke through the formal feudal barriers of courtly and choral dance styles. There is a basic principle that distinguishes a hot medium like radio from a cool one like the telephone, or a hot medium like the movie from a cool one like TV. A hot medium is one that extends one single sense in “high definition.” High definition is the state of being well filled with data. A photograph is, visually, “high definition.” A cartoon is “low definition,” simply because very little visual information is provided. Telephone is a cool medium. or one of low definition, because the ear is given a meager amount of information. And speech is a cool medium of low definition, because so little is given and so much has to be filled in by the listener. On the other hand, ho, media do not leave so much to be filled in or completed by the audience. Hot media are, therefore, low in participation, and cool media are high in participation or completion by the audience. Naturally, therefore, a hot medium like radio has very different effects on the user from a cool medium like the telephone. A cool medium like hieroglyphic or ideogrammic written characters has very different effects from the hot and explosive medium of the phonetic alphabet. The alphabet, when pushed to a high degree of abstract visual intensity, became typography. The printed word with its specialist intensity burst the bonds of medieval corporate guilds and monasteries, creating extreme individualist patterns of enterprise and monopoly. But the typical reversal occurred when extremes of monopoly brought back the corporation, with its impersonal empire over many lives. The hotting-up of the medium of writing to repeatable print intensity led to nationalism and the religious wars of the sixteenth century. The heavy and unwieldy media, such as stone, are time binders. Used for writing, they are very cool indeed, and serve to unify the ages; whereas paper is a hot medium that serves to unify spaces horizontally, both in political and entertainment empires. Any hot medium allows of less participation than a cool one, as a lecture makes for less participation than a seminar, and a book for less than dialogue. With print many earlier forms were excluded from life and art, and many were given strange new intensity. But our own time is crowded with examples of the principle that the hot form excludes, and the cool one includes. When ballerinas began to dance on their toes a century ago, it was felt that the art of the ballet had acquired a new “spirituality.” With this new intensity, male figures were excluded from ballet. The role of women had also become fragmented with the advent of industrial specialism and the explosion of home functions into laundries, bakeries, and hospitals on the periphery of the community. Intensity or high definition engenders specialism and fragmentation in living as in entertainment, which explains why any intense experience must be “forgotten,” “censored,” and reduced to a very cool state before it can be “learned” or assimilated. The Freudian “censor” is less of a moral function than an indispensable condition of learning.

The link, known as the hot line, will be opened within sixty days, according to U.S. officials. It will make use of leased commercial circuits, one cable and the other wireless, using teleprinter equipment. The decision to use the hot printed medium in place of the cool, participational, telephone medium is unfortunate in the extreme. No doubt the decision was prompted by the literary bias of the West for the printed form, on the ground that it is more impersonal than the telephone. The printed form has quite different implications in Moscow from what it has in Washington. So with the telephone. The Russians' love of this instrument, so congenial to their oral traditions, is owing to the rich nonvisual involvement it affords. The Russian uses the telephone for the sort of effects we associate with the eager conversation of the lapel-gripper whose face is twelve inches away. Both telephone and teleprinter as amplifications of the unconscious cultural bias of Moscow, on one hand, and of Washington, on the other, are invitations to monstrous misunderstandings. The Russian bugs rooms and spies by ear, finding this quite natural. He is outraged by our visual spying, however, finding this quite unnatural. The principle that during the stages of their development all things appear under forms opposite to those that they finally present is an ancient doctrine. Interest in the power of things to reverse themselves by evolution is evident in a great diversity of observations, sage and jocular. Alexander Pope wrote: Vice is a monster of such frightful mien As to be hated needs but to be seen; But seen too oft, familiar with its face, We first endure, then pity, then embrace. A caterpillar gazing at the butterfly is supposed to have remarked. “Waal, you’ll never catch me in one of those durn things.” At another level we have seen in this century the changeover from the debunking of traditional myths and legends to their reverent study. As we begin to react in depth to the social life and problems of our global village, we become reactionaries. Involvement that goes with our instant technologies transforms the most “socially conscious” people into conservatives. When Sputnik had first gone into orbit a schoolteacher asked her second-graders to write some verse of the subject. One child wrote: The stars are so big, The earth is so small, Stay as you are. With man his knowledge and the process of obtaining knowledge are of equal magnitude. Our ability to apprehend galaxies and subatomic structures, as well, is a movement of faculties that include and transcend them. The second-grader who wrote the words above lives in a world much vaster than any which a scientist today has instruments to measure, or concepts to describe. As W B. Yeats wrote of this reversal, “The visible world is no longer a reality and the unseen world is no longer a dream.” Associated with this transformation of the real world into science fiction is the reversal now proceeding apace, by which the Western world is going Eastern, even as the East goes Western. Joyce encoded this reciprocal reverse in his cryptic phrase: The West shall shake the East awake While ye have the night for morn. The title of his Finnegans Wake is a set of multi-leveled puns on the reversal by which Western man enters his tribal, or Finn, cycle once more, following the track of the old Finn, but wide awake this time as we re-enter the tribal night. It is like our contemporary consciousness of the Unconscious. The stepping-up of speed from the mechanical to the instant electric form reverses explosion into implosion.

It is from the Greek word narcosis, or numbness. The youth Narcissus mistook his own reflection in the water for another person. This extension of himself by mirror numbed his perceptions until he became the servomechanism of his own extended or repeated image. The nymph Echo tried to win his love with fragments of his own speech, but in vain. He was numb. He had adapted to his extension of himself and had become a closed system. Now the point of this myth is the fact that men at once become fascinated by any extension of themselves in any material other than themselves. There have been cynics who insisted that men fall deepest in love with women who give them back their own image. Be that as it may, the wisdom of the Narcissus myth does not convey any idea that Narcissus fell in love with anything he regarded as himself. Obviously he would have had very different feelings about the image had he known it was an extension or repetition of himself. It is, perhaps, indicative of the bias of our intensely technological and, therefore, narcotic culture that we have long interpreted the Narcissus story to mean that he fell in love with himself, that he imagined the reflection to be Narcissus! Physiologically there are abundant reasons for an extension of ourselves involving us in a state of numbness. Medical researchers like Hans Selye and Adolphe Jonas hold that all extensions of ourselves, in sickness or in health, are attempts to maintain equilibrium. Any extension of ourselves they regard as “autoamputation,” and they find that the autoamputative power or strategy is resorted to by the body when the perceptual power cannot locate or avoid the cause of irritation. Our language has many expressions that indicate this self-amputation that is imposed by various pressures. We speak of “wanting to jump out of my skin” or of “going out of my mind,” being “driven batty” or “flipping my lid.” And we often create artificial situations that rival the irritations and stresses of real life under controlled conditions of sport and play. While it was no part of the intention of Jonas and Selye to provide an explanation of human invention and technology, they have given us a theory of disease (discomfort) that goes far to explain why man is impelled to extend various parts of his body by a kind of autoamputation. In the physical stress of superstimulation of various kinds, the central nervous system acts to protect itself by a strategy of amputation or isolation of the offending organ, sense, or function. Thus, the stimulus to new invention is the stress of acceleration of pace and increase of load. For example, in the case of the wheel as an extension of the toot, the pressure of new burdens resulting from the acceleration of exchange by written and monetary media was the immediate occasion of the extension or “amputation” of this function from our bodies. The wheel as a counter-irritant to increased burdens, in turn, brings about a new intensity of action by its amplification of a separate or isolated function (the feet in rotation). Such amplification is bearable by the nervous system only through numbness or blocking of perception. This is the sense of the Narcissus myth. The young man’s image is a self-amputation or extension induced by irritating pressures. As counter-irritant, the image produces a generalized numbness or shock that declines recognition. Self-amputation forbids self-recognition. The principle of self-amputation as an immediate relief of strain on the central nervous system applies very readily to the origin of the media of communication from speech to computer. Physiologically, the central nervous system, that electric network that coordinates the various media of our senses, plays the chief role. Whatever threatens its function must be contained, localized, or cut o","date":"2022-03-06","objectID":"/en/understanding_media/:1:5","tags":["媒体","media"],"title":"Understanding Media: The Extension","uri":"/en/understanding_media/"},{"categories":["媒体","media"],"content":"**5 HYBRID ENERGY: Les Liaisons Dangereuses ** “For most of our lifetime civil war has been raging in the world of art and entertainment. . . . Moving pictures, gramophone records, radio, talking pictures. …” This is the view of Donald McWhinnie, analyst of the radio medium. Most of this civil war affects us in the depths of our psychic lives, as well, since the war is conducted by forces that are extensions and amplifications of our own beings. Indeed, the interplay among media is only another name for this civil war\" that rages in our society and our psyches alike. “To the blind all things are sudden,” it has been said. The crossings or hybridizations of the media release great new force and energy as by fission or fusion. There need be no blindness in these matters once we have been notified that there is anything to observe. It has now been explained that media, or the extensions of man, are “make happen” agents, but not “make aware” agents. The hybridizing or compounding of these agents offers an especially favorable opportunity to notice their structural components and properties. “As the silent film cried out for sound so does the sound film cry out for color,” wrote Sergei Eisenstein in his Notes of a Film Director. This type of observation can be extended systematically to all media: “As the printing press cried out for nationalism, so did the radio cry out for tribalism” These media, being extensions of ourselves, also depend upon us for their interplay and their evolution. The fact that they do interact and spawn new progeny has been a source of wonder over the ages. It need baffle us no longer if we trouble to scrutinize their action. We can, if we choose, think things out before we put them out. Plato, in all his striving to imagine an ideal training school, failed to notice that Athens was a greater school than any university even he could dream up. In other words, the greatest school had been put out for human use before it has been thought out. Now, this is especially true of our media. They are put out long before they are thought out. In fact, their being put outside us tends to cancel the possibility of their being thought of at all. Everybody notices how coal and steel and cars affect the arrangements of daily existence. In our time, study has finally turned to the medium of language itself as shaping the arrangements of daily life, so that society begins to look like a linguistic echo or repeat of language norms, a fact that has disturbed the Russian Communist party very deeply. Wedded as they are to nineteenth-century industrial technology as the basis of class liberation, nothing could be more subversive of the Marxian dialectic than the idea that linguistic media shape social development, as much as do the means of production. In fact, of all the great hybrid unions that breed furious release of energy and change, there is none to surpass the meeting of literate and oral cultures. The giving to man of an eye for an ear by phonetic literacy is, socially and politically, probably the most radical explosion mat can occur in any social structure. This explosion of the eye, frequently repeated in “backward areas,” we call Westernization. With literacy now about to hybridize the cultures of the Chinese, the Indians, and the Africans, we are about to experience such a release of human power and aggressive violence as makes the previous history of phonetic alphabet technology seem quite tame. That is only the East side story, for the electric implosion now brings oral and tribal ear-culture to the literate West. Not only does the visual, specialist, and fragmented Westerner have now to live in closest daily association with all the ancient oral cultures of the earth, but his own electric technology now begins to translate the visual or eye man back into the tribal and oral pattern with its seamless web of kinship and interdependence.

Some stutterers lose their stutter when they switch to a foreign language. That technologies are ways of translating one kind of knowledge into another mode has been expressed by Lyman Bryson in the phrase “technology is explicitness.” Translation is thus a ‘spelling-out\" of forms of knowing. What we call “mechanization ' is a translation of nature, and of our own natures, into amplified and specialized forms. Thus the quip in Finnegans Wake, “What bird has done yesterday man may do next year,” is a strictly literal observation of the courses of technology. The Power of technology as dependent on alternately grasping and letting go in order to enlarge the scope of action has been observed as the power of the higher arboreal apes as compared with those that are on the ground. Elias Canetti made the proper association of this power of the higher apes to grasp and let go, with the strategy of the stock market speculators. It is all capsulated in the popular variant on Robert Browning: “A man’s reach must exceed his grasp or what’s a metaphor.” All media are active metaphors in their power to translate experience into new forms. The spoken word was the first technology by which man was able to let go of his environment in order to grasp it in a new way. Words are a kind of information retrieval that can range over the total environment and experience at high speed. Words are complex systems of metaphors and symbols that translate experience into our uttered or outered senses. They are a technology of explicitness. By means of translation of immediate sense experience into vocal symbols the entire world can be evoked and retrieved at any instant. In this electric age we see ourselves being translated more and more into the form of information, moving toward the technological extension of consciousness. That is what is meant when we say that we daily know more and more about man. We mean that we can translate more and more of ourselves into other forms of expression that exceed ourselves. Man is a form of expression who is traditionally expected to repeat himself and to echo the praise of his Creator. “Prayer,” said George Herbert, “is reversed thunder.” Man has the power to reverberate the Divine thunder, by verbal translation. By putting our physical bodies inside our extended nervous systems, by means of electric media, we set up a dynamic by which all previous technologies that are mere extensions of hands and feet and teeth and bodily heat-controls–all such extensions of our bodies, including cities–will be translated into information systems. Electromagnetic technology requires utter human docility and quiescence of meditation such as befits an organism that now wears its brain outside its skull and its nerves outside its hide. Man must serve his electric technology with the same servo-mechanistic fidelity with which he served his coracle, his canoe, his typography, and all other extensions of his physical organs. But there is this difference, that previous technologies were partial and fragmentary, and the electric is total and inclusive. An external consensus or conscience is now as necessary as private consciousness. With the new media, however, it is also possible to store and to translate everything; and, as for speed, that is no problem. No further acceleration is possible this side of the light barrier. Just as when information levels rise in physics and chemistry, it is possible to use anything for fuel or fabric or building material, so with electric technology all solid goods can be summoned to appear as solid commodities by means of information circuits set up in the organic patterns that we call “automation” and information retrieval. Under electric technology the entire business of man becomes learning and knowing.

A. N. Whitehead, on the other hand, explained how the great discovery of the nineteenth century was the discovery of the technique of discovery. Namely, the technique of starting with the thing to be discovered and working back, step by step, as on an assembly line, to the point at which it is necessary to start in order to reach the desired object. In the arts this meant starting with the effect and then inventing a poem, painting, or building that would have just that effect and no other. But the “technique of the suspended judgment” goes further. It anticipates the effect of, say, an unhappy childhood on an adult, and offsets the effect before it happens. In psychiatry, it is the technique of total permissiveness extended as an anesthetic for the mind, while various adhesions and moral effects of false judgments are systematically eliminated. This is a very different thing from the numbing or narcotic effect of new technology that lulls attention while the new form slams the gates of judgment and perception. For massive social surgery is needed to insert new technology into the group mind, and this is achieved by the built-in numbing apparatus discussed earlier Now the “technique of the suspended judgment” presents the possibility of rejecting the narcotic and of postponing indefinitely the operation of inserting the new technology in the social psyche. A new stasis is in prospect. Werner Heisenberg, in The Physicist’s Conception of Nature, is an example of the new quantum physicist whose over-all awareness of forms suggests to him that we would do well to stand aside from most of them. He points out that technical change alters not only habits of life, but patterns of thought and valuation, citing with approval the outlook of the Chinese sage: AsTzu-Gung was traveling through the regions north of the river Han, he saw an old man working in his vegetable garden. He had dug an irrigation ditch. The man would descend into a well, fetch up a vessel of water in his arms and pour it out into the ditch. While his efforts were tremendous the results appeared to be very meager. Tzu-Gung said, “There is a way whereby you can irrigate a hundred ditches in one day, and whereby you can do much with little effort. Would you not like to hear of it?” Then the gardener stood up, looked at him and said, “And what would that be?” Tsu-Gung replied, “You take a wooden lever, weighted at the back and light in front. In this way you can bring up water so quickly that it just gushes out. This is called a draw-well.” Then anger rose up in the old man’s face, and he said, “I have heard my teacher say that whoever uses machines does all his work like a machine. He who does his work like a machine grows a heart like a machine, and he who carries the heart of a machine in his breast loses his simplicity. He who has lost his simplicity becomes unsure in the strivings of his soul. Uncertainty in the strivings of the soul is something which does not agree with honest sense. It is not that I do not know of such things; I am ashamed to use them.” Perhaps the most interesting point about this anecdote is that it appeals to a modern physicist. It would not have appealed to Newton or to Adam Smith, for they were great experts and advocates of the fragmentary and the specialist approaches. It is by means quite in accord with the outlook of the Chinese sage that Hans Selye works at his “stress” idea of illness. In the 1920s he had been baffled at why physicians always seemed to concentrate on the recognition of individual diseases and specific remedies for such isolated causes, while never paying any attention to the “syndrome of just being sick.” Those who are concerned with the program “content” of media and not with the medium proper, appear to be in the position of physic","date":"2022-03-06","objectID":"/en/understanding_media/:1:8","tags":["媒体","media"],"title":"Understanding Media: The Extension","uri":"/en/understanding_media/"},{"categories":["媒体","media"],"content":"Part II ","date":"2022-03-06","objectID":"/en/understanding_media/:2:0","tags":["媒体","media"],"title":"Understanding Media: The Extension","uri":"/en/understanding_media/"},{"categories":["媒体","media"],"content":"8 THE SPOKEN WORD: Flower of Evil? A few seconds from a popular disk-jockey show were typed out as follows: That’s Patty Baby and that’s the girl with the dancing feet and that’s Freddy Cannon there on the David Mickie Show in the night time ooohbah scubadoo how are you booboo.

Dave Mickie alternately soars, groans, swings, sings, solos, intones, and scampers, always reacting to his own actions. He moves entirely in the spoken rather than the written area of experience. It is in this way that audience participation is created. The spoken word involves all of the senses dramatically, though highly literate people tend to speak as connectedly and casually as possible. The sensuous involvement natural to cultures in which literacy is not the ruling form of experience is sometimes indicated in travel guides, as in this item from a guide to Greece: You will notice that many Creek men seem to spend a lot of time counting the beads of what appear to be amber rosaries. But these have no religious significance. They are komboloia or “worry beads,” a legacy from the Turks, and Creeks click them on land, on the sea, in the air to ward off that insupportable silence which threatens to reign whenever conversation lags. Shepherds do it, cops do it, stevedores and merchants in their shops do it. And if you wonder why so few Creek women wear beads, you’ll know it’s because their husbands have preempted them for the simple pleasure of clicking. More aesthetic than thumb-twiddling, less expensive than smoking, this Queeg-like obsession indicates a tactile sensuousness characteristic of a race which has produced the western world’s greatest sculpture. Where the heavy visual stress of literacy is lacking in a culture, there occurs another form of sensuous involvement and cultural apprecauon that our Greek guide explains whimsically: …do not be surprised at the frequency with which you are patted, petted and prodded in Greece. You may end up feeling like the family dog… in an affectionate family. This propensity to pat seems to us a tactile extension of the avid Greek curiosity noted before. It’s as though your hosts are trying to find out what you are made of. The widely separate characters of the spoken and written words are easy to study today when there is ever closer touch with nonliterate societies. One native, the only literate member of his group, told of acting as reader for the others when they received letters. He said he felt impelled to put his fingers to his ears while reading aloud, so as not to violate the privacy of their letters. This is interesting testimony to the values of privacy fostered by the visual stress of phonetic writing. Such separation of the senses, and of the individual from the group, can scarcely occur without the influence of phonetic writing. The spoken word does not afford the extension and amplification of the visual power needed for habits of individualism and privacy. It helps to appreciate the nature of the spoken word to contrast it with the written form. Although phonetic writing separates and extends the visual power of words, it is comparatively crude and slow. There are not many ways of writing “tonight,” but Stanislavsky used to ask his young actors to pronounce and stress it fifty different ways while the audience wrote down the different shades of feeling and meaning expressed. Many a page of prose and many a narrative has been devoted to expressing what was, in effect, a sob, a moan, a laugh, or a piercing scream. The written word spells out in sequence what is quick and implicit in the spoken word.

I gradually came to understand that the marks on the pages were trapped words. Anyone could learn to decipher the symbols and turn the trapped words loose again into speech. The ink of the print trapped the thoughts; they could no rnore get away than a daomboo could get out of a pit. When the full realization of what this meant flooded over me, I experienced the same thrill and amazement as when I had my first glimpse of the bright lights of Konakry. I shivered with the intensity of my desire to learn to do this wondrous thing myself. In striking contrast to the native’s eagerness, there are the current anxieties of civilized man concerning the written word. To some Westerners the written or printed word has become a very touchy subject. It is true that there is more material written and printed and read today than ever before, but there is also a new electric technology that threatens this ancient technology of literacy built on the phonetic alphabet. Because of its action in extending our central nervous system, electric technology seems to favor the inclusive and participational spoken word over the specialist written word. Our Western values, built on the written word have already been considerably affected by the electric media of telephone, radio, and TV Perhaps that is the reason why many highly literate people in our time find it difficult to examine this question without getting into a moral panic. There is the further circumstance that, during his more than two thousand years of literacy, Western man has done little to study or to understand the effects of the phonetic alphabet in creating many of his basic patterns of culture. To begin now to examine the question may, therefore, seem too late. Suppose that, instead of displaying the Stars and Stripes, we were to write the words “American flag” across a piece of cloth and to display that. While the symbols would convey the same meaning, the effect would be quite different. To translate the rich visual mosaic of the Stars and Stripes into written form would be to deprive it of most of its qualities of corporate image and of experience, yet the abstract literal bond would remain much the same. Perhaps this illustration will serve to suggest the change the tribal man experiences when he becomes literate. Nearly all the emotional and corporate family feeling is eliminated from his relationship with his social group. He is emotionally free to separate from the tribute and to become a civilized individual, a man of visual organization who has uniform attitudes, habits, and rights with all other civilized individuals. The Greek myth about the alphabet was that Cadmus, reputedly the king who introduced the phonetic letters into Greece, sowed the dragon’s teeth, and they sprang up arm men. Like any other myth, this one capsulates a prolonged process into a flashing insight. The alphabet meant power and authority and control of military structures at a distance. When combined with papyrus, the alphabet spelled the end of the stationary temple bureaucracies and the priestly monopolies of knowledge and power. Unlike pre-alphabetic writing, which with its innumerable signs was difficult to master, the alphabet could be learned in a few hours. The acquisition of so extensive a knowledge and so complex a skill as pre-alphabetic writing represented, when applied to such unwieldy materials as brick and stone, insured for the scribal caste a monopoly of priestly power. The easier alphabet and the light, cheap, transportable papyrus together effected the transfer of power from the priestly to the military class. All this is implied in the myth about Cadmus and the dragon’s teeth, including the fall of the city states, the rise of empires and military bureaucracies.

Before this, roads and the written word were closely interrelated. It is only since the telegraph that information has detached itself from such solid commodities as stone and papyrus, much as money had earlier detached itself from hides, bullion, and metals, and has ended as paper. The term “communication” has had an extensive use in connection with roads and bridges, sea routes, rivers, and canals, even before it became transformed into “information movement” in the electric age. Perhaps there is no more suitable way of defining the character of the electric age than by first studying the rise of the idea of transportation as communication, and then the transition of the idea from transport to information by means of electricity. The word “metaphor” is from the Greek meld plus pherein, to carry across or transport. In this book we are concerned with all forms of transport of goods and information, both as metaphor and exchange. Each form of transport not only carries, but translates and transforms, the sender, the receiver, and the message. The use of any kind of medium or extension of man alters the patterns of interdependence among people, as it alters the ratios among our senses. It is a persistent theme of this book that all technologies are extensions of our physical and nervous systems to increase power and speed. Again, unless there were such increases of power and speed, new extensions of ourselves would not occur or would be discarded. For an increase of power or speed in any kind of grouping of any components whatever is itself a disruption that causes a change of organization. The alteration of social groupings, and the formation of new communities, occur with the increased speed of information movement by means of paper messages and road transport. Such speed-up means much more control at much greater distances. Historically, it meant the formation of the Roman Empire and the disruption of the previous city-states of the Greek world. Before the use of papyrus and alphabet created the incentives for building fast, hard-surface roads, the walled town and the city-state were natural forms that could endure. Village and city-state essentially are forms that include all human needs and functions. With greater speed and, therefore, greater military control at a distance, the city-state collapsed. Once inclusive and self-contained, its needs and functions were extended in the specialist activities of an empire. Speed-up tends to separate functions, both commercial and political, and acceleration beyond a point in any system becomes disruption and breakdown. So when Arnold Toynbee turns, in A Study of History, to a massive documentation of “the breakdowns of civilizations,” he begins by saying: “One of the most conspicuous marks of disintegration, as we have already noticed, is … when a disintegrating civilisation purchases a reprieve by submitting to forcible political unification in a universal state.” Disintegration and reprieve, alike, are the consequence of ever faster movement of information by couriers on excellent roads. Speed-up creates what some economists refer to as a center-margin structure. When this becomes too extensive for the generating and control center, pieces begin to detach themselves and to set up new center-margin systems of their own. The most familiar example is the story of the American colonies of Great Britain. When the thirteen colonies began to develop a considerable social and economic life of their own, they felt the need to become centers themselves, with their own margins. This is the time when the original center may make a more rigorous effort of centralized control of the margins, as, indeed, Great Britain did. The slowness of sea travel proved altogether inadequate to the maintenance of so extensive an empire on a mere center-margin basis.

After 1870 the heel-clicking members of the German army had become the new symbol of tribal unity and power. In England and America the same sense of numerical grandeur from sheer numbers was associated with the mounting output of industry, and the statistics of wealth and production: “tanks a million.” The power of sheer numbers, in wealth or in crowds, to set up a dynamic drive toward growth and aggrandizement is mysterious. Elias Canetti in Crowds and Power illustrates the profound tie between monetary inflation and crowd behavior. He is baffled by our failure to study inflation as a crowd phenomenon, since its effects on our modern world are pervasive. The drive toward unlimited growth inherent in any kind of crowd, heap, or horde would seem to link economic and Population inflation. In the theater, at a ball, at a ball game, in church, every individual enjoys all those others present. The pleasure of being among the masses is the sense of the joy in the multiplication of numbers, which has long been suspect among the literate members of Western society. In such society, the separation of the individual from the group in space (privacy), and in thought (“point of view”), and in work (specialism), has had the cultural and technological support of literacy, and its attendant galaxy of fragmented industrial and political institutions. But the power of the printed word to create the homogenized social man grew steadily until our time, creating the paradox of the “mass mind” and the mass militarism of citizen armies. Pushed to the mechanized extreme, letters have often seemed to produce effects opposite to civilization, just as numbering in earlier times seemed to break tribal unity, as the Old Testament declares (“And Satan rose up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel”). Phonetic letters and number were the first means of fragmenting and detribalizing man. Throughout Western history we have traditionally and rightly regarded letters as the source of civilization, and looked to our literatures as the hallmark of civilized attainment. Yet all along, there has been with us a shadow of number, the language of science. In isolation, number is as mysterious as writing. Seen as an extension of our physical bodies, it becomes quite intelligible. Just as writing is an extension and separation of our most neutral and objective sense, the sense of sight, number is an extension and separation of our most intimate and interrelating activity, our sense of touch. This faculty of touch, called the “haptic” sense by the Greeks, was popularized as such by the Bauhaus program of sensuous education, through the work of Paul Klee, Walter Gropius, and many others in the Germany of the 1920s. The sense of touch, as offering a kind of nervous system or organic unity in the work of art, has obsessed the minds of the artists since the time of Cezanne. For more than a century now artists have tried to meet the challenge of the electric age by investing the tactile sense with the role of a nervous system for unifying all the others. Paradoxically, this has been achieved by “abstract art,” which offers a central nervous system for a work of art, rather than the conventional husk of the old pictorial image. More and more it has occurred to people that the sense of touch is necessary to integral existence. The weightless occupant of the space capsule has to fight to retain the integrating sense of touch. Our mechanical technologies for extending and separating the functions of our physical beings have brought us near to a state of disintegration by putting us out of touch with ourselves. It may very well be that in our conscious inner lives the interplay among our senses is what constitutes the sense of touch. Perhaps touch is not just skin contact with things, but the very life of things in the mind?

Clothing as an extension of our skin helps to store and to channel energy, so that if the Westerner needs less food, he may also demand more sex. Yet neither clothing nor sex can be understood as separate isolated factors, and many sociologists have noted that sex can become a compensation for crowded living. Privacy, like individualism, is unknown in tribal societies, a fact that Westerners need to keep in mind when estimating the attractions of our way of life to nonliterate peoples. Clothing, as an extension of the skin, can be seen both as a heat-control mechanism and as a means of denning the self socially. In these respects, clothing and housing are near twins, though clothing is both nearer and elder; for housing extends the inner heat-control mechanisms of our organism, while clothing is a more direct extension of the outer surface of the body. Today Europeans have begun to dress for the eye, American-style, just at the moment when Americans have begun to abandon their traditional visual style. The media analyst knows why these opposite styles suddenly transfer their locations. The European, since the Second War, has begun to stress visual values; his economy, not coincidentally, now supports a large amount of uniform consumer goods. Americans, on the other hand, have begun to rebel against uniform consumer values for the first time. In cars, in clothes, in paperback books; in beards, babies, and beehive hairdos, the American has declared for stress on touch, on participation, involvement, and sculptural values. America, once the land of an abstractly visual order, is profoundly “in touch” again with European traditions of food and life and art. What was an avant-garde program for the 1920 expatriates is now the teenagers' norm. The Europeans, however, underwent a sort of consumer revolution at the end of the eighteenth century. When industrialism was a novelty, it became fashionable among the upper classes to abandon rich, courtly attire in favor of simpler materials. That was the time when men first donned the trousers of the common foot soldier (or pioneer, the original French usage), but it was done at that time as a kind of brash gesture of social “integration.” Up until then, the feudal system had inclined the upper classes to dress as they spoke, in a courtly style quite removed from that of ordinary people. Dress and speech were accorded a degree of splendor and richness of texture that universal literacy and mass production were eventually to eliminate completely. The sewing machine, for example, created the long straight line in clothes, as much as the linotype flattened the human vocal style. A recent ad for C-E-I-R Computer Services pictured a plain cotton dress and the headline: “Why does Mrs. ‘K’ dress that way?” –referring to the wife of Nikita Khrushchev. Some of the copy of this very ingenious ad continued: “It is an icon. To its own underprivileged population and to the uncommitted of the East and South, it says: ‘We are thrif-ty, simple, hon-est; peaceful, home-y, go-od.’ To the free nations of the West it says: ‘We will bury you.’ \" This is precisely the message that the new simple clothing of our forefathers had for the feudal classes at the time of the French Revolution. Clothing was then a nonverbal manifesto of political upset. Today in America there is a revolutionary attitude expressed as much in our attire as in our patios and small cars. For a decade and more, women’s dress and hair styles have abandoned visual for iconic–or sculptural and tactual–stress. Like toreador pants and gaiter stockings, the beehive hairdo is also iconic and sensuously inclusive, rather than abstractly visual. In a word, the American woman for the first time presents herself as a person to be touched and handled, not just to be looked at.

Housing as shelter is an extension of our bodily heat-control mechanisms –a collective skin or garment. Cities are an even further extension of bodily organs to accommodate the needs of large groups. Many readers are familiar with the way in which lames Joyce organized Ulysses by assigning the various city forms “I walls, streets, civic buildings, and media to the various bodily organs. Such a parallel between the city and the human body enabled Joyce to establish a further parallel between ancient Ithaca and modern Dublin, creating a sense of human unity in depth, transcending history. Baudelaire originally intended to call his Flairs du Mai, Lei mines, having in mind the city as corporate extensions of our physical organs. Our letting-go of ourselves, self-alienations, as it were, in order to amplify or increase the power of various functions, Baudelaire considered to be flowers of growths of evil. The city as amplification of human lusts and sensual striving had for him an entire organic and psychic unity. Literate man, civilized man, tends to restrict and enclose space and to separate functions, whereas tribal man had freely extended the form of his body to include the universe. Acting as an organ of the cosmos, tribal man accepted his bodily functions as modes of participation in the divine energies. The human body in Indian religious thought was ritually related to the cosmic image, and this in turn was assimilated into the form of house. Housing was an image of both the body and the universe for tribal and nonliterate societies. The building of the house with its hearth as fire-altar was ritually associated with the act of creation. This same ritual was even more deeply embedded in the building of the ancient cities, their shape and process having been deliberately modeled as an act of divine praise. The city and the home in the tribal world (as in China and India today) can be accepted as iconic embodiments of the word, the divine mythos, the universal aspiration. Even in our present electric age, many people yearn for this inclusive strategy of acquiring significance for their own private and isolated beings. Literate man, once having accepted an analytic technology of fragmentation, is not nearly so accessible to cosmic patterns as tribal man. He prefers separateness and compartmented spaces, rather than the open cosmos. He becomes less inclined to accept his body as a model of the universe, or to see his house – or any other of the media of communication, for that matter – as a ritual extension of his body. Once men have adopted the visual dynamic of the phonetic alphabet, they begin to lose the tribal man’s obsession with cosmic order and ritual as recurrent in the physical organs and their social extension. Indifference to the cosmic, however, fosters intense concentration on minute segments and specialist tasks, which is the unique strength of Western man. For the specialist is one who never makes small mistakes while moving toward the grand fallacy. Men live in round houses until they become sedentary and specialized in their work organization. Anthropologists have often noted this change from round to square without knowing its cause. The media analyst can help the anthropologist in this matter, although the explanation will not be obvious to people of visual culture. The visual man, likewise, cannot see much difference between the motion picture and TV, or between a Corvair and a Volkswagen, for this difference is not between two visual spaces, but between tactile and visual ones. A tent or a wigwam is not an enclosed or visual space. Neither is a cave nor a hole in the ground. These kinds of space – the tent, the wigwam, the igloo, the cave – are not “enclosed” in the visual sense because they fo","date":"2022-03-06","objectID":"/en/understanding_media/:2:6","tags":["媒体","media"],"title":"Understanding Media: The Extension","uri":"/en/understanding_media/"},{"categories":["媒体","media"],"content":"14 MONEY: The Poor Man’s Credit Card Central to modern psychoanalytical theory is the relation between the money complex and the human body. Some analysts derive money from the infantile impulse to play with faeces. Ferenczi, in particular, calls money “nothing other than odorless dehydrated filth that has been made to shine.” Ferenczi, in his concept of money, is elaborating Freud’s concept of “Character and Anal Erotism.” Although this idea of linking “filthy lucre” with the anal has continued in the main lines of psychoanalysis, it does not correspond sufficiently to the nature and function of money in society to provide a theme for the present chapter. Money began in nonliterate cultures as a commodity, such as whales' teeth on Fiji; or rats on Easter Island, which later were considered a delicacy, were valued as a luxury, and thus became a means of mediation or barter. When the Spaniards were besieging Leyden in 1574, leather money was issued, but as hardship increased the population boiled and ate the new currency. In literate cultures, circumstances may reintroduce commodity money. The Dutch, after the German occupation of World War II, were avid for tobacco. Since the supply was small, objects of high value such as jewels, precision instruments, and even houses were sold for small quantities of cigarettes. The Reader’s Digest recorded an episode from the early occupation of Europe in 1945, describing how an unopened pack of cigarettes served as currency, passing from hand to hand, translating the skill of one worker into the skill of another as long as no one broke the seal. Money always retains something of its commodity and community character. In the beginning, its function of extending the grasp of men from their nearest staples and commodities to more distant ones is very slight. Increased mobility of grasp and trading is small at first. So it is with the emergence of language in the child. In the first months grasping is reflexive, and the power to make voluntary release comes only toward the end of the first year. Speech comes with the development of the power to let go of objects. It gives the power of detachment from the environment that is also the power of great mobility in knowledge of the environment. So it is with the growth of the idea of money as currency rather than commodity. Currency is a way of letting go of the immediate staples and commodities that at first serve as money, in order to extend trading to the whole social complex. Trading by currency is based on the principle of grasping and letting go in an oscillating cycle. The one hand retains the article with which it tempts the other party. The other hand is extended in demand toward the object which is desired in exchange. The first hand lets go as soon as the second object is touched, somewhat in the manner of a trapeze artist exchanging one bar for another. In fact, Elias Canetti in Crowds and Power argues that the trader is Involved in one of the most ancient of all pastimes, namely that of climbing trees and swinging from limb to limb. The primitive grasping, calculating, and timing of the greater arboreal apes he sees as a translation into financial terms of one of the oldest movement patterns. Just as the hand among the branches of the trees learned a pattern of grasping that was quite removed from the moving of food to mouth, so the trader and the financier have developed enthralling abstract activities that are extensions of the avid climbing and mobility of the greater apes. Like any other medium, it is a staple, a natural resource. As an outward and visible form of the urge to change and to exchange, it is a corporate image, depending on society for its institutional status. Apart from communal participation, money is meaningless, as Robinson Crusoe discovered when he found the coins in the wrecked ship: I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. “O drug!” said I aloud, “What art thou good for?

Just as a great revolution in mathematics came when positional, tandem numbers were discovered (302 instead of 32, and so on), so great cultural changes occurred in the West when it was found possible to fix time as something that happens between two points. From this application of visual, abstract, and uniform units came our Western feeling for time as duration. From our division of time into uniform, visualizable units comes our sense of duration and our impatience when we cannot endure the delay between events. Such a sense of impatience, of time as duration, is unknown among non literate cultures. Just as work began with the division of labor, duration begins with the division of time, and especially with those subdivisions by which mechanical clocks impose uniform succession on the time sense. As a piece of technology, the clock is a machine that produces uniform seconds, minutes, and hours on an assembly-line pattern. Processed in this uniform way, time is separated from the rhythms of human experience. The mechanical clock, in short, helps to create the image of a numerically quantified and mechanically powered universe. It was in the world of the medieval monasteries, with their need for a rule and for synchronized order to guide communal life, that the clock got started on its modern developments. Time measured not by the uniqueness of private experience but by abstract uniform units gradually pervades all sense life, much as does the technology of writing and printing. Not only work, but also eating and sleeping, came to accommodate themselves to the clock rather than to organic needs. As the pattern of arbitrary and uniform measurement of time extended itself across society, even clothing began to undergo annual alteration in a way convenient for industry. At that point, of course, mechanical measurement of time as a principle of applied knowledge joined forces with printing and assembly line as means of uniform fragmentation of processes. The most integral and involving time sense imaginable is that expressed in the Chinese and Japanese cultures. Until the coming of the missionaries in the seventeenth century, and the introduction of the mechanical clocks, the Chinese and Japanese had for thousands of years measured time by graduations of incense. Not only the hours and days, but the seasons and zodiacal signs were simultaneously indicated by a succession of carefully ordered scents. The sense of smell, long considered the root of memory and the unifying basis of individuality, has come to the fore again in the experiments of Wilder Penfield. During brain surgery, electric probing of brain tissue revived many memories of the patients. These evocations were dominated and unified by unique scents and odors that structured these past experiences. The sense of smell is not only the most subtle and delicate of the human senses; it is, also, the most iconic in that it involves the entire human sensorium more fully than any other sense. It is not surprising, therefore, that highly literate societies take steps to reduce or eliminate odors from the environment. B.O., the unique signature and declaration of human individuality, is a bad word in literate societies. It is far too involving for our habits of detachment and specialist attention. Societies that measured time scents would tend to be so cohesive and so profoundly unified as to resist every kind of change. Lewis Mumford has suggested that the clock preceded the printing press in order of influence on the mechanization of society. But Mumford takes no account of the phonetic alphabet as the technology that had made possible the visual and uniform fragmentation of time.

But it is usually forgotten that without prints and blueprints, without maps and geometry, the world of modern sciences and technologies would hardly exist. In the time of Ferdinand and Isabella and other maritime monarchs, maps were top-secret, like new electronic discoveries today. When the captains returned from their voyages, every effort was made by the officers of the crown to obtain both originals and copies of the maps made during the voyage. The result was a lucrative black-market trade, and secret maps were widely sold. The sort of maps in question had nothing in common with those of later design, being in fact more like diaries of different adventures and experiences. For the later perception of space as uniform and continuous was unknown to the medieval cartographer, whose efforts resembled modern nonobjective art. The shock of the new Renaissance space is still felt by natives who encounter it today for the first time. Prince Modupe tells in his autobiography, I Was a Savage, how he had learned to read maps at school, and how he had taken back home to his village a map of a river his father had traveled for years as a trader. . . .my father thought the whole idea was absurd. He refused to identify the stream he had crossed at Bomako, where it is no deeper, he said, than a man is high, with the great widespread waters of the vast Niger delta. Distances as measured in miles had no meaning for him. . . . Maps are liars, he told me briefly. From his tone of voice I could tell that I had offended him in some way not known to me at the time. The things that hurt one do not show on a map. The truth of a place is in the joy and the hurt that come from it. I had best not put my trust in anything as inadequate as a map, he counseled. … I understand now, although I did not at the time, that my airy and easy sweep of map-traced staggering distances belittled the jour-neys he had measured on tired feet. With my big map-talk, I had effaced the magnitude of his cargo-laden, heat-weighted treks. All the words in the world cannot describe an object like a bucket, although it is possible to tell in a few words how to make a bucket. This inadequacy of words to convey visual information about objects was an effectual block to the development of the Greek and Roman sciences. Pliny the Elder reported the inability of the Greek and Latin botanists to devise a means of transmitting information about plants and flowers: Hence it is that other writers have confined themselves to a verbal description of the plants; indeed some of them have not so much as described them even, but have contented themselves for the most part with a bare recital of their names . .. We are confronted here once more with that basic function of media –to store and to expedite information. Plainly, to store is to expedite, since what is stored is also more accessible than what has to be gathered. The fact that visual information about flowers and plants cannot be stored verbally also points to the fact that science in the Western world has long been dependent on the visual factor. Nor is this surprising in a literate culture based on the technology of the alphabet, one that reduces even spoken language to a visual mode. As electricity has created multiple non-visual means of storing and retrieving information, not only culture but science also has shifted its entire base and character. For the educator, as well as the philosopher, exact knowledge of what this shift means for learning and the mental process is not necessary. Well before Gutenberg’s development of printing from movable types, a great deal of printing on paper by woodcut had been done. Perhaps the most popular form of this kind of block printing of text and image had been in the form of the Biblia Pauperum, or Bibles of the Poor.

He began as a provider of copy for a popular cartoonist. To consider the comics here, after “The Print,” is to fix attention upon the persistent print-like, and even crude woodcut, characteristics of our twentieth-century comics. It is by no means easy to perceive how the same qualities of print and woodcut could reappear in the mosaic mesh of the TV image. TV is so difficult a subject for literary people that it has to be approached obliquely. From the three million dots per second on TV, the viewer is able to accept, in an iconic grasp, only a few dozen seventy or so, from which to shape an image. The image thus made is as crude as that of the comics. It is for this reason that the print and the comics provide a useful approach to understanding the TV image, for they offer very little visual information or connected detail. Painters and sculptors, however, can easily understand TV, because they sense how very much tactile involvement is needed for the appreciation of plastic art. The structural qualities of the print and woodcut obtain, also, in the cartoon, all of which share a participational and do-it-yourself character that pervades a wide variety of media experiences today. The print is clue to the comic cartoon, just as the cartoon is clue to understanding the TV image. Many a wrinkled teenager recalls his fascination with that pride of the comics, the “Yellow Kid” of Richard F. Outcault. On first appearance, it was called “Hogan’s Alley” in the New York Sunday World. It featured a variety of scenes of kids from the tenements, Maggie and Jiggs as children, as it were. This feature sold many papers in 1898 and thereafter. Hearst soon bought it, and began large scale comic supplements. Comics (as already explained in the chapter on The Print), being low in definition, are a highly participational form of expression, perfectly adapted to the mosaic form of the newspaper. They provide, also, a sense of continuity from one day to the next. The individual news item is very low in information, and requires completion or fill-in by the reader, exactly as does the TV image, or the wirephoto. That is the reason why TV hit the comic-book world so hard. It was a real rival, rather than a complement. But TV hit the pictorial ad world even harder, dislodging the sharp and glossy, in favor of the shaggy, the sculptural, and the tactual. Hence the sudden eminence of MAD magazine which offers, merely, a ludicrous and cool replay of the forms of the hot media of photo, radio, and film. MAD is the old print and woodcut image that recurs in various media today. Its type of configuration will come to shape all of the acceptable TV offerings. The biggest casualty of the TV impact was Al Capp’s “Li 1 Abner.” For eighteen years Al Capp had kept Li’l Abner on the verge of matrimony. The sophisticated formula used with his characters was the reverse of that employed by the French novelist Stendhal, who said, “I simply involve my people in the consequences of their own stupidity and then give them brains so they can suffer.” Al Capp, in effect, said, “I simply involve my people in the consequences of their own stupidity and then take away their brains so that they can do nothing about it.” Their inability to help themselves created a sort of parody of all the other suspense comics. Al Capp pushed suspense into absurdity. But readers have long enjoyed the fact that the Dogpatch predicament of helpless ineptitude was a paradigm of the human situation, in general. With the arrival of TV and its iconic mosaic image, the everyday life situations began to seem very square, indeed. Al Capp suddenly found that his kind of distortion no longer worked. He felt that Americans had lost their power to laugh at themselves. He was wrong. TV simply involved everybody in everybody more deeply than before.

Printing from movable types was the first mechanization of a complex handicraft, and became the archetype of all subsequent mechanization. From Rabelais and More to Mill and Morris, the typographic explosion extended the minds and voices of men to reconstitute the human dialogue on a world scale that has bridged the ages. For if seen merely as a store of information, or as a new means of speedy retrieval of knowledge, typography ended parochialism and tribalism, psychically and socially, both m space and in time. Indeed the first two centuries of printing from movable types were motivated much more by the desire to see ancient and medieval books than by the need to read and write new ones. Until 1 700 much more than 50 per cent of all printed books were ancient or medieval. Not only antiquity but also the Middle Ages were given to the first reading public of the printed word. And the medieval texts were by far the most popular. Like any other extension of man, typography had psychic and social consequences that suddenly shifted previous boundaries and patterns of culture. In bringing the ancient and medieval worlds into fusion –or, as some would say, confusion – the printed book created a third world, the modern world, which now encounters a new electric technology or a new extension of man. Electric means of moving of information are altering our typographic culture as sharply as print modified medieval manuscript and scholastic culture. Beatrice Warde has recently described in Alphabet an electric display of letters painted by light. It was a Norman McLaren movie advertisement of which she asks Do you wonder that I was late for the theatre that night, when I tell you that I saw two club-footed Egyptian A’s . . . walking off arm-in-arm with the unmistakable swagger of a music-hall comedy-team? I saw base-serifs pulled together as if by ballet shoes, so that the letters tripped off literally sur les pointes . . . after forty centuries of the necessarily static Alphabet, I saw what its members could do in the fourth dimension of Time, “flux,” movement. You may well say that I was electrified. Nothing could be farther from typographic culture with its “place for everything and everything in its place.” Mrs. Warde has spent her life in the study of typography and she shows sure tact in her startled response to letters that are not printed by types but painted by light. It may be that the explosion that began with phonetic letters (the “dragon’s teeth” sowed by King Cadmus) will reverse into “implosion” under the impulse of the instant speed of electricity. The alphabet (and its extension into typography) made possible the spread of the power that is knowledge, and shattered the bonds of tribal man, thus exploding him into agglomeration of individuals. Electric writing and speed pour upon him, instantaneously and continuously, the concerns of all other men. He becomes tribal once more. The human family becomes one tribe again. Any student of the social history of the printed book is likely to be puzzled by the lack of understanding of the psychic and social effects of printing. In five centuries explicit comment and awareness of the effects of print on human sensibility are very scarce. But the same observation can be made about all the extensions of man, whether it be clothing or the computer. An extension appears to be an amplification of an organ, a sense or a function, that inspires the central nervous system to a self-protective gesture of numbing of the extended area, at least so far as direct inspection and awareness are concerned.

Scholars tend to work on the archeological assumption that things need to be studied in isolation. This is the habit of specialism that quite naturally derives from typographic culture. When a scholar like Lynn White ventures to make some interrelations, even in his own area of special historical study, he causes a good deal of unhappiness among his merely specialist colleagues. In his Medieval Technology and Social Change he explains how the feudal system was a social extension of the stirrup. The stirrup first appeared in the West in the eighth century A.D., having been introduced from the East. With the stirrup came mounted shock combat that called into existence a new social class. The European cavalier class had already existed to be armed, but to mount a knight in full armor required the combined resources often or more peasant holdings. Charlemagne demanded that less prosperous freemen merge their private farms to equip a single knight for the wars. The pressure of the new war technology gradually developed classes and an economic system that could provide numerous cavaliers in heavy armor. By about the year 1000 A.D. the old word miles had changed from “soldier” to “knight.” Lynn White has much to say, also, about horseshoes and horse-collars as revolutionary technology that increased the power and extended the range and speed of human action in the early Middle Ages. He is sensitive to the psychic and social implications of each technological extension of man, showing how the heavy wheel-plow brought about a new order in the field system, as well as in the diet of that age. “The Middle Ages were literally full of beans.” To come more directly to our subject of the wheel, Lynn White explains how the evolution of the wheel in the Middle Ages was related to the development of the horsecollar and the harness. The greater speed and endurance of the horse was not available for cartage until the discovery of the collar. But once evolved, this horse-harness led to the development of wagons with pivoted front axles and brakes. The four-wheel wagon capable of hauling heavy loads was a common feature by the middle of the thirteenth century. The effects on town life were extraordinary. Peasants began to live in cities while going each day to their fields, almost in the manner of motorized Saskatchewan farmers. These latter live mainly in the city, having no housing in the country beyond sheds for their tractors and equipment. With the coming of the horse-drawn bus and streetcar, American towns developed housing that was no longer within sight of shop or factory. The railroad next took over the development of the suburbs, with housing kept within walking distance of the railroad stop. Shops and hotels around the railroad gave some concentration and form to the suburb. The automobile, followed by the airplane, dissolved this grouping and ended the pedestrian, or human, scale of the suburb. Lewis Mumford contends that the car turned the suburban housewife into a full-time chauffeur. Certainly the transformations of the wheel as expediter of tasks, and architect of ever-new human relations, is far from finished, but its shaping power is waning in the electric age of information, and that fact makes us much more aware of its characteristic form as now tending toward the archaic. Before the emergence of the wheeled vehicle, there was merely the abrasive traction principle -runners, skids, and skis preceded wheels for vehicles, just as the abrasive, semirotary motion of the hand-operated spindle and drill preceded the full, free rotary motion of the potter’s wheel. There is a moment of translation or “abstraction” needed to separate the reciprocating movement of hand from the free movement of wheel. “Doubtless the notion of the wheel came originally from observing that rolling a log was ea","date":"2022-03-06","objectID":"/en/understanding_media/:2:12","tags":["媒体","media"],"title":"Understanding Media: The Extension","uri":"/en/understanding_media/"},{"categories":["媒体","media"],"content":"20 THE PHOTOGRAPH: The Brothel-without-Walls A photograph of “St. Peter’s at a Moment of History” was the cover feature of Life magazine for June 14, 1963. It is one of the peculiar characteristics of the photo that it isolates single moments in time. The TV camera does not. The continuous scanning action of the TV camera provides, not the isolated moment or aspect, but the contour, the iconic profile and the transparency. Egyptian art, like primitive sculpture today, provided the significant outline that had nothing to do with a moment in time. Sculpture tends toward the timeless. Awareness of the transforming power of the photo is often embodied in popular stories like the one about the admiring friend who said, “My, that’s a fine child you have there!” Mother: “Oh, that’s nothing. You should see his photograph.” The power of the camera to be everywhere and to interrelate things is well indicated in the Vogue magazine boast (March 15, 1953): “A woman now, and without having to leave the country can have the best of five (or more) nations hanging in her closet –beautiful and compatible as a statesman’s dream.” That is why, in the photographic age, fashions have come to be like the collage style in painting. A century ago the British craze for the monocle gave to the wearer the power of the camera to fix people in a superior stare, as if they were objects. Eric von Stroheim did a great job with the monocle in creating the haughty Prussian officer. Both monocle and camera tend to turn people into things, and the photograph extends and multiplies the human image to the proportions of mass-produced merchandise. The movie stars and matinee idols are put in the public domain by photography. They become dreams that money can buy. They can be bought and hugged and thumbed more easily than public prostitutes. Mass-produced merchandise has always made some people uneasy in its prostitute aspect. Jean Genet’s The Balcony is a play on this theme of society as a brothel environed by violence and horror. The avid desire of mankind to prostitute itself stands up against the chaos of revolution. The brothel remains firm and permanent amidst the most furious changes. In a word, photography has inspired Genet with the theme of the world since photography as a Brothel- without-Walls. Nobody can commit photography alone. It is possible to have at least the illusion of reading and writing in isolation, but photography does not foster such attitudes. If there is any sense in deploring the growth of corporate and collective art forms such as the film and the press, it is surely in relation to the previous individualist technologies that these new forms corrode. Yet if there had been no prints or woodcuts and engravings, there would never have come the photograph. For centuries, the woodcut and the engraving had delineated the world by an arrangement of lines and points that had syntax oi a very elaborate kind. Many historians of this visual syntax, like in Seurat’s pointillisme, and is still continued in the newspaper mesh of dots that is called “wirephoto.” Within a year of Daguerre’s discovery, Samuel F. B. Morse was taking photo- graphs of his wife and daughter in New York City. Dots for the eye (photograph) and dots for the ear (telegraph) thus met on top of a skyscraper. A further cross-fertilization occurred in Talbot’s invention of the photo, which he imagined as an extension of the camera obscura, or pictures in “the little dark room,” as the Italians had named the picture play-box of the sixteenth century. Just at the time when mechanical writing had been achieved by movable types, there grew up the pastime of looking at moving images on the wall of a dark room. If there is sunshine outside and a pin-hole in one wall, then the images of the outer world will appear on the wall opposite. This new discovery was very exciting to painters, since it intensified the new illusion of perspective and of the third dimension that is so closely related","date":"2022-03-06","objectID":"/en/understanding_media/:2:13","tags":["媒体","media"],"title":"Understanding Media: The Extension","uri":"/en/understanding_media/"},{"categories":["媒体","media"],"content":"21 PRESS: Government by News Leak The headline for an Associated Press release (February 25, 1963) read: PRESS BLAMED FOR SUCCESS KENNEDY MANAGES NEWS BOLDLY, CYNICALLY, SUBTLY, KROCK CLAIMS Arthur Krock is quoted as saying that “the principle onus rests on the printed and electronic prprocess itself.” That may seem like another way of saying that “history is to blame.” But it is the instant consequences of electrically moved iformation that make necessary a deliberate artistic aim in the placing and management of news. In diplomacy the same electric speed causes the decisions to be announced before they are made in order to ascertain the varying responses that might occur when such decisions actually are made. Such procedure, quite inevitable at the electric speed that involves the entire society in the decision-making process, shocks the old press men because it abdicates any definite point of view. As the speed of information increases, the tendency is for politics to move away from representation and delegation of constituents toward immediate involvement of the entire community in the central acts of decision. Slower speeds of information make delegation and representation mandatory. Associated with such delegation are the points of view of the different sectors of public interest that are expected to be put forward for processing and consideration by the rest of the community. When the electric speed is introduced into such a delegated and representational organization, this obsolescent organization can only be made to function by a series of subterfuges and makeshifts. These strike some observers as base betrayals of the original aims and purposes of the established forms. The massive theme of the press can be managed only by direct contact with the formal patterns of the medium in question. It is thus necessary to state at once that “human interest” is a technical term meaning that which happens when multiple book pages or multiple information items are arranged in a mosaic on one sheet. The book is a private confessional form that provides a “point of view.” The press is a group confessional form that provides communal participation. It can “color” events by using them or by not using them at all. But it is the daily communal exposure of multiple items in juxtaposition that gives the press its complex dimension of human interest. The book form is not a communal mosaic or corporate image but a private voice. One of the unexpected effects of TV on the press has been a great increase in the popularity of Time and Newsweek. Quite inexplicably to themselves and without any new effort at subscription, their circulations have more than doubled since TV. These news magazines are preeminently mosaic in form, offering not windows on the world like the old picture magazines, but presenting corporate images of society in action. Whereas the spectator of a picture magazine is passive, the reader of a news magazine becomes much involved in the making of meanings for the corporate image. Thus the TV habit of involvement in mosaic image has greatly strengthened the appeal of these news magazines, but at the same time has diminished the appeal of the older pictorial feature magazines. Both book and newspaper are confessional in character, creating the effect of inside story by their mere form, regardless of content. As the book page yields the inside story of the author’s mental adventures, so the press page yields the inside story of the community in action and interaction. It is for this reason that the press seems to be performing its function most when revealing the seamy side. Real news is bad news –bad news about somebody, or bad news for somebody. In 1962, when Minneapolis had been for months without a newspaper, the chief of police said: “Sure, I miss the news, but so far as my job goes I hope the papers never come back. There is less crime around without a newspaper to pass around the ideas.” Even before the telegraph speed-u","date":"2022-03-06","objectID":"/en/understanding_media/:2:14","tags":["媒体","media"],"title":"Understanding Media: The Extension","uri":"/en/understanding_media/"},{"categories":["媒体","media"],"content":"22 MOTORCAR: The Mechanical Bride Here is a news items that captures a good deal of the meaning of the automobile in relation to social life: I was terrific. There I was in my white Continental, and I was wearing a pure-silk, pure-white, embroidered cowboy shirt, and black gabardine trousers. Beside me in the car was my jet-black Great Dane imported from Europe, named Dana von Krupp. You just can’t do any better than that. Although it may be true to say that an American is a creature of four wheels, and to point out that American youth attributes much more importance to arriving at driver’s-license age than at voting age, it is also true that the car has become an article of dress without which we feel uncertain, unclad, and incomplete in the urban compound. Some observers insist that, as a status symbol, the house has, of late, supplanted the car. If so, this shift from the mobile open road to the manicured roots of suburbia may signify a real change in American orientation. There is a growing uneasiness about the degree to which cars have become the real population of our cities, with a resulting loss of human scale, both in power and in distance. The town planners are plotting ways and means to buy back our cities for the pedestrian from the big transportation interests. Lynn White tells the story of the stirrup and the heavy-armored knight in his Medieval Technology and Social Change. So expensive yet so mandatory was the armored rider for shock combat, that the cooperative feudal system came into existence to pay for his equipment. Renaissance gunpowder and ordnance ended the military role of the knight and returned the city to the pedestrian burgess. If the motorist is technologically and economically far superior to the armored knight, it may be that electric changes in technology are about to dismount him and return us to the pedestrian scale. “Going to work” may be only a transitory phase, like “going shopping.” The grocery interests have long foreseen the possibility of shopping by two-way TV, or video-telephone. William M Freeman, writing for The New York Times Service (Tuesday, October 15, 1963), reports that there will certainly be “a decided transition from today’s distribution vehicles. . . . Mrs. Customer will be able to tune in on various stores. Her credit identification will be picked up automatically via television. Items in full and faithful coloring will be viewed. Distance will hold no problem, since by the end of the century the consumer will be able to make direct television connections regardless of how many miles are involved.” What is wrong with all such prophecies is that they assume a stable framework of fact –in this case, the house and the storeٛ which is usually the first to disappear. The changing relation between customer and shopkeeper is as nothing compared to the changing pattern of work itself, in an age of automation. It is true that going-to and coming-from work are almost certain to lose all of their present character. The car as vehicle, in that sense, will go the way of the horse. The horse has lost its role in transportation but has made a strong comeback in entertainment. So with the motorcar. Its future does not belong in the area of transportation. Had the infant automotive industry; in 1910, seen fit to call a conference to consider the future of the horse, the discussion would have been concerned to discover new jobs for the horse and new kinds of training to extend the usefulness of the horse. The complete revolution in transportation and in housing and city arrangement would have been ignored. The turn of our economy to making and servicing motorcars, and the devotion of much leisure time to their use on a vast new highway system, would not even have been thought of. In other words, it is the framework itself that changes with new technology, and not just the picture within the frame.

The product matters less as the audience participation increases. An extreme example is the corset series that protests that “it is not the corset that you ieel. The need is to make the ad include the audience experience. The product and the public response become a single complex pattern. The art of advertising has wondrously come to fulfill the early definition of anthropology as “the science of man embracing woman.” The steady trend in advertising is to manifest the product as an integral part of large social purposes and processes. With very large budgets the commercial artists have tended to develop the ad into an icon, and icons are not specialist fragments or aspects but unified and compressed images of complex kind. They focus a large region of experience in tiny compass. The trend in ads, then, is away from the consumer picture of product to the producer image of process. The corporate image of process includes the consumer in the producer role as well. This powerful new trend in ads toward the iconic image has greatly weakened the position of the magazine industry in general and the picture magazines in particular. Magazine features have long employed the pictorial treatment of themes and news. Side by side with these magazine features that present shots and fragmentary points of view, there are the new massive iconic ads with their compressed images that include producer and consumer, seller and society in a single image. The ads make the features seem pale, weak, and anemic. The features belong to the old pictorial world that preceded TV mosaic imagery. It is the powerful mosaic and iconic thrust in our experience since TV that explains the paradox of the upsurge of Time and News week and similar magazines. These magazines present the news in a compressed mosaic form that is a real parallel to the ad world. Mosaic news is neither narrative, nor point of view, nor explanation, nor comment. It is a corporate image in depth of the community in action and invites maximal participation in the social process. Ads seem to work on the very advanced principle that a small pellet or pattern in a noisy, redundant barrage of repetition will gradually assert itself. Ads push the principle of noise all the way to the plateau of persuasion. They are quite in accord with the procedures of brain-washing. This depth principle of onslaught on the unconscious may be the reason why. Many people have expressed uneasiness about the advertising enterprise in our time. To put the matter abruptly, the advertising industry is a crude attempt to extend the principles of automation to every aspect of society. Ideally, advertising aims at the goal of a programmed harmony among all human impulses and aspirations and endeavors. Using handicraft methods, it stretches out toward the ultimate electronic goal of a collective consciousness. When all production and all consumption are brought into a pre-established harmony with all desire and all effort, then advertising will have liquidated itself by its own success. Since the advent of TV, the exploitation of the unconscious by the advertiser has hit a snag. TV experience favors much more consciousness concerning the unconscious than do the hard-sell forms of presentation in the press, the magazine, movie, or radio. The sensory tolerance of the audience has changed, and so have the methods of appeal by the advertisers. In the new cool TV world, the old hot world of hard-selling, earnest-talking salesmen has all the antique charm of the songs and togs of the 1920s. Mort Sahl and Shelley Berman are merely following, not setting, a trend in spoofing the ad world. They discovered that they have only to reel off an ad or news item to have the audience in fits.

In our intensely individualist and fragmented Western world, “booze” is a social bond and a means of festive involvement. By contrast, in closely knit tribal society “booze” is destructive of all social pattern and is even used as a means to mystical experience. In tribal societies, gambling, on the other hand, is a welcome avenue of entrepreneurial effort and individual initiative. Carried into an individualist society, the same gambling games and sweepstakes seem to threaten the whole social order.Gambling pushes individual initiative to the point of mocking the individualist social structure. The virtue is the capitalist When the boys came home from the mud and blood baths of the Western Front in 1918 and 1919, they encountered the Volstead Prohibmon Act. It was the social and political recognition that the war had fraternalized and tribalized us to the point where alcohol was a threat to an individualist society. When we too are prepared to legalize gambling, we shall, like the English, announce to the world the end of individualist society and the trek back to tribal ways. We think of humor as a mark of sanity for a good reason: in fun and play we recover the integral person, who in the workaday world or in professional life can use only a small sector of his being. Philip Deane, in Captive in Korea, tells a story about games in the midst of successive brain washings that is to the point. There came a time when I had to stop reading those books, to stop practising Russian because with the study of language the absurd and constant assertion began to leave its mark, began to find an echo, and I felt my thinking processes getting tangled, my critical faculties getting blunted. . . . then they made a mistake. They gave us Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island in English. … I could read Marx again, and question myself honestly without fear. Robert Louis Stevenson made us lighthearted, so we started dancing lessons. Games are popular art, collective, social reactions to the main drive or action of any culture. Games, like institutions, are extensions of social man and of the body politic, as technologies are extensions of the animal organism. Both games and technologies are counter-irritants or ways of adjusting to the stress of the specialized actions that occur in any social group. As extensions of the popular response to the workaday stress, games become faithful models of a culture. They incorporate both the action and the reaction of whole populations in a single dynamic image. A Reuters dispatch for December 13, 1962, reported from Tokyo: BUSINESS IS A BATTLEFIELD Latest fashion among Japanese businessmen is the study of classical military strategy and tactics in order to apply them to business operations…. It has been reported that one of the largest advertising companies in Japan has even made these books compulsory reading for all its employees. Long centuries of tight tribal organization now stand the Japanese in very good stead in the trade and commerce of the electric age. A few decades ago they underwent enough literacy and industrial fragmentation to release aggressive individual energies. The close teamwork and tribal loyalty now demanded by electrical intercom again puts the Japanese in positive relation to their ancient traditions. Our own tribal ways are much too remote to be of any social avail.

Crippen, a U.S. physician who had been practicing in London, muerdered his wiefe,buried her int he cellar of their home, and fled the country with is secretary aboard the linear Montrose. The secretary was dresseda s boy, and the pair traveled as Mr. Robinson and son. Captain George Kendal of the Montrose became suspicious of the Robinsons, having read int eh English papers about he Crippen case. The Montrose was one of the few ships then equipped with Marconi’s werless. binding his werless operator ot secrecy, Captain DEndall sent a message to Scotland Yard, and the Yard sent Inspector Dews on a faster liner to reae the Montrose across the Atlantic. Inspector Dews, dressed as a pilot, boarded the ontrose before it reached port and, and arrested Crippen. Eighteen months after Crippen’s arrest, an act was passed in the British Parliament making it compulsory for all passenger ships to carry ireless. The Crippen case illustrates what happens to the best-laid plans of mice and men in any organization when the instant speed of information movement begins. There is a collapse of delegated authority and a dissolution of the pyramid and management structures made familiar in the organization chart. The separation of functions, and the division of stages, spaces, and tasks are characteristic of literate and visual society and of the Western world. These divisions tend to dissolve through the action of the instant and organic interrelations of electricity. Former German Armaments minister Albert Speer, in a speech at the Nuremberg trials, made some bitter remarks about the effects of electric media on German life: “The telephone, the teleprinter and the wireless made it possible for orders from the highest levels to be given direct to the lowest levels, where, on account of the absolute authority behind them, they were carried out uncritically …” The tendency of electric media is to create a kind of organic interdependence among all the institutions of society, emphasizing de Chardin’s view that the discovery of electromagnetism is to be regarded as “a prodigious biological event.” If political and commercial institutions take on a biological character by means of electric communications, it is also common now for biologists like Hans Selye to think of the physical organism as a communication network: “Hormone is a specific chemical messenger-substance, made by an endocrine gland and secreted into the blood, to regulate and coordinate the functions of distant organs.” This peculiarity about the electric form, that it ends the mechanical age of individual steps and specialist functions, has a direct explanation. Whereas all previous technology (save speech, itself) had, in effect, extended some part of our bodies, electricity may be said to have outered the central nervous system itself, including the brain. Our central nervous system is a unified field quite without segments. As J. Z. Young writes in Doubt and Certainty in Science: A Biologist’s Reflections on the Brain (Galaxy, Oxford University Press, New York, 1960): It may be that a great part of the secret of the brain’s power is the enormous opportunity provided for interaction between the effects of stimulating each part of the receiving fields. It is this provision of interacting-places or mixing-places that allows us to react to the world as a whole to a much greater degree than most other animals can do. Failure to understand the organic character of electric technology is evident in our continuing concern with the dangers of mechanizing the world. Rather, we are in great danger of wiping out our entire investment in the preelectric technology of the literate and mechanical kind by means of an indiscriminate use of electrical energy.

For example: The invention of the typewriter has given a tremendous impetus to the dictating habit… . This means not only greater diffuseness … but it also brings forward the point of view of the one who speaks. There is the disposition on the part of the talker to explain, as if watching the facial expression of his hearers to see how far they are following. This attitude is not lost when his audience is following. It is no uncommon thing in the typewriting booths at the Capitol in Washington to see Congressmen in dictating letters use the most vigorous gestures as if the oratorical methods of persuasion could be transmitted to the printed page. In 1882, ads proclaimed that the typewriter could be used as an aid in learning to read, write, spell, and punctuate. Now, eighty years later, the typewriter is used only in experimental classrooms. The ordinary classroom still holds the typewriter at bay as a merely attractive and distractive toy. But poets like Charles Olson are eloquent in proclaiming the power of the typewriter to help the poet to indicate exactly the breath, the pauses, the suspension, even, of syllables, the juxtaposition, even, of parts of phrases which he intends, observing that, for the first time, the poet has the stave and the bar that the musician has had. The same kind of autonomy and independence which Charles Olson claims that the typewriter confers on the voice of the poet was claimed for the typewriter by the career woman of fifty years ago. British women were reputed to have developed a “twelve-pound look” when typewriters became available for sixty dollars or so. This look was in some way related to the Viking gesture of Ibsen’s Nora Helmer, who slammed the door of her doll’s house and set off on a quest of vocation and soul-testing. The age of the iron whim had begun. The reader will recall earlier mention that when the first wave of female typists hit the business office in the 1890s, the cuspidor manufacturers read the sign of doom. They were right. More important, the uniform ranks of fashionable lady typists made possible a revolution in the garment industry. What she wore, every farmer’s daughter wanted to wear, for the typist was a popular figure of enterprise and skill. She was a style-maker who was also eager to follow styles. As much as the typewriter, the typist brought into business a new dimension of the uniform, the homogeneous, and the continuous that has made the typewriter indispensable to every aspect of mechanical industry. A modern battleship needs dozens of typewriters for ordinary operations. An army needs more typewriters than medium and light artillery pieces, even in the field, suggesting that the typewriter now fuses the functions of the pen and sword. But the effect of the typewriter is not all of this kind. If the typewriter has contributed greatly to the familiar forms of the homogenized specialism and fragmentation that is print culture, it has also caused an integration of functions and the creation of much private independence. G. K. Chesterton demurred about this new independence as a delusion, remarking that “women refused to be dictated to and went out and became stenographers.” The poet or novelist now composes on the typewriter. The typewriter fuses composition and publication, causing an entirely new attitude to the written and printed word. Composing on the typewriter has altered the forms of the language and of literature in ways best seen in the later novels of Henry James that were dictated to Miss Theodora Bosanquet, who took them down, not by shorthand, but on a typewriter. Her memoir, Henry James at Work, should have been followed by other studies of how the typewriter has altered English verse and prose, and, indeed, the very mental habits, themselves, of ","date":"2022-03-06","objectID":"/en/understanding_media/:2:19","tags":["媒体","media"],"title":"Understanding Media: The Extension","uri":"/en/understanding_media/"},{"categories":["媒体","media"],"content":"27 THE TELEPHONE: Sounding Brass or Tinkling Symbol? The readers of the New York Evening Telegram were told in 1904-“Phony implies that a thing so qualified has no more substance than a telephone talk with a supposititious friend.” The folklore of the telephone in song and story has been augmented in the memoirs of Jack Paar, who writes that his resentment toward the telephone began with the singing telegram. He tells how he got a call from a woman who said she was so lonesome she had been taking a bath three times a day in hopes that the phone would ring. James Joyce in Finnegans Wake head-lined TELEVISION KILLS TELEPHONY IN BROTHERS BROIL, introducing a major theme in the battle of the technologically extended senses that has, indeed, been raging through our culture for more than a decade. With the telephone, there occurs the extension of ear and voice that is of extra sensory perception. With television came the extension of the sense of touch or of sense interplay that even more intimately involves the entire sensorium. The child and the teenager understand the telephone, embracing the cord and the ear-mike as if they were beloved pets. What we call “the French phone,” the union of mouthpiece and earphone in a single instrument, is a significant indication of the French liaison of the senses that English-speaking people keep firmly separate. French is “the language of love” just because it unites voice and ear in an especially close way, as does the telephone. So it is quite natural to kiss via phone, but not easy to visualize while phoning. No more unexpected social result of the telephone has been observed than its elimination of the red-light district and its creation of the call-girl. To the blind, all things are unexpected. The form and character of the telephone, as of all electric technology, appear fully in this spectacular development. The prostitute was a specialist, and the call-girl is not. A “house” was not a home; but the call-girl not only lives at home, she may be a matron. The power of the telephone to decentralize every operation and to end positional warfare, as well as localized prostitution, has been felt but not understood by every business in the land. The telephone, in the case of the call-girl, is like the typewriter that fuses the functions of composition and publication. The call-girl dispenses with the procurer and the madam. She has to be an articulate person of varied conversation and social accomplishments since she is expected to be able to join any company on a basis of social equality. If the typewriter has splintered woman from the home and turned her into a specialist in the office, the telephone gave her back to the executive world as a general means of harmony, an invitation to happiness, and a sort of combined confessional-and wailing wall for the immature American executive. The typewriter and the telephone are most unidentical twins that have taken over the revamping of the American girl with technological ruthlessness and thoroughness. Since all media are fragments of ourselves extended into the public domain, the action upon us of any one medium tends to bring the other senses into play in a new relation. As we read, we provide a sound track for the printed word; as we listen to the radio, we provide a visual accompaniment. Why can we not visualize while telephoning? At once the reader will protest, “But I do visualize on the telephone!” When he has a chance to try the experiment deliberately, he will find that he simply can’t visualize while phoning, though all literate people try to do so and, therefore, believe they are succeeding. But that is not what most irritates the literate and visualizing Westerner about the telephone. Some people can scarcely talk to their best friends on the phone without becoming angry. The telephone demands complete participation, unlike the written and printed page.

That the world of sound is essentially a unified field of instant relationships lends it a near resemblance to the world of electromagnetic waves. This fact brought the phonograph and radio into early association. Just how obliquely the phonograph was at first received is indicated in the observation of John Philip Sousa, the brass-band director and composer. He commented: “With the phonograph vocal exercises will be out of vogue! Then what of the national throat? Will it not weaken? What of the national chest? Will it not shrink?” One fact Sousa had grasped: The phonograph is an extension and amplification of the voice that may well have diminished individual vocal activity, much as the car had reduced pedestrian activity. Like the radio that it still provides with program content, the phonograph is a hot medium. Without it, the twentieth century as the era of tango, ragtime, and jazz would have had a different rhythm. But the phonograph was involved in many misconceptions, as one of its early names-gramophone-implies. It was conceived as a form of auditory writing (gramma-letters). It was also called “graphophone,” with the needle in the role of pen. The idea of it as a “talking machine” was especially popular. Edison was delayed in his approach to the solution of its problems by considering it at first as a “telephone repeater”; that is, a storehouse of data from the telephone, enabling the telephone to “provide invaluable records, instead of being the recipient of momentary and fleeting communication.” These words of Edison, published in the North .American Review of June, 1878, illustrate how the then recent telephone invention already had the power to color thinking in other fields. So, the record player had to be seen as a kind of phonetic record of telephone conversation. Hence, the names “phonograph” and “gramophone.” Behind the immediate popularity of the phonograph was the entire electric implosion that gave such new stress and importance to actual speech rhythms in music, poetry, and dance alike. Yet the phonograph was a machine merely. It did not at first use an electric motor or circuit. But in providing a mechanical extension of the human voice and the new ragtime melodies, the phonograph was propelled into a central place by some of the major currents of the age. The fact of acceptance of a new phrase or a speech form, or a dance rhythm is already direct evidence ot some actual development to which it is significantly related. Take, for example, the shift of English into an interrogative mood, since the arrival of “How about that?” Nothing could induce people to begin suddenly to use such a phrase over an over unless there were some new stress, rhythm, or nuance in interpersonal relations that gave it relevance. It was while handling paper tape, impressed by Morse Code dots and dashes, that Edison noticed the sound given off when the tape moved at high speed resembled human talk heard indistinctly \" It then occurred to him that indented tape could record a telephone message. Edison became aware of the limns of lineality and the sterility of specialism as soon as he entered the electric field. “Look,” he said, “it’s like this. I start here with the intention of reaching here in an experiment, say, to increase the speed of the Atlantic cable; but when I’ve arrived part way in my straight line, I meet with a phenomenon, and it leads me off in another direction and develops into a phonograph.” Nothing could more dramatically express the turning point from mechanical explosion to electrical implosion. Edison’s own career embodied that very change in our world, and he himself was often caught in the confusion between the two forms of procedure.

The movie, by which we roll up the real world on a spool in order to unroll it as a magic carpet of fantasy, is a spectacular wedding of the old mechanical technology and the new electric world In the chapter on The Wheel, the story was told of how the movie had a kind of symbolic origin in an attempt to photograph the flying hooves of galloping horses, for to set a series of cameras to study animal movement is to merge the mechanical and the organic in a special way. In the medieval world, curiously the one static form for another, in sequence. They imagined the life of a flower as a kind of cinematic strip of phases for essences. The movie is the total realization of the medieval idea of change, in the form of an entertaining illusion. Physiologists had very much to do with the development of film, as they did with the telephone. On film the mechanical appears as organic, and the growth of a flower can be portrayed as easily and as freely as the movement of a horse. If the movie merges the mechanical and organic in a world of undulating forms, it also links with the technology of print. The reader in projecting words, as it were, has to follow the black and white sequences of stills that is typography, providing his own sound track. He tries to follow the contours of the author’s mind, at varying speeds and with various illusions of understanding. It would be difficult to exaggerate the bond between print and movie in terms of their power to generate fantasy in the viewer or reader. Cervantes devoted his Don Quixote entirely to this aspect of the printed word and its power to create what James Joyce throughout Finnegcms Wake designates as “the ABCED-minded,” which can be taken as “ab-said” or “ab-sent,” or just alphabetically controlled. The business of the writer or the film-maker is to transfer the reader or viewer from one world, his own, to another, the world created by typography and film. That is so obvious, and happens so completely, that those undergoing the experience accept it subliminally and without critical awareness. Cervantes lived in a world in which print was as new as movies are in the West, and it seemed obvious to him that print, like the images now on the screen, had usurped the real world. The reader or spectator had become a dreamer under their spell, as Rene Clair said of film in 1926. Movies as a nonverbal form of experience are like photography, a form of statement without syntax. In fact, however, like the print and the photo, movies assume a high level of literacy in their users and prove baffling to the nonliterate. Our literate acceptance of the mere movement of the camera eye as it follows or drops a figure from view is not acceptable to an African film audience, if somebody disappears off the side of the film, the African wants to know what happened to him. A literate audience however, accustomed to following printed imagery line by line without questioning the logic of lineality, will accept film sequence without protest. It was Rene Clair who pointed out that if two or three people were together on a stage, the dramatist must ceaselessly motivate or explain their being there at all. But the film audience, like the book reader, accepts mere sequence as rational. Whatever the camera turns to, the audience accepts. We are transported to another world. As Rene Clair observed, the screen opens its white door into a harem of beautiful visions and adolescent dreams, compared to which the loveliest real body seems defective. Yeats saw the movie as a world of Platonic ideals with the film projector playing “a spume upon a ghostly paradigm of things.” This was the world that haunted Don Quixote, who found it through the folio door of the newly printed romances.

These forms involve an intense visual organization of experience. The more earthy and less visual European cultures were not immune to radio. Its tribal magic was not lost on them, and the old web of kinship began to resonate once more with the note of fascism. The inability of literate people to grasp the language and mesmentts of the media as such is involuntarily conveyed by the comments of sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld discussing the effects of The last group of effects may be called the monopolititic effects of radio. such have traced most public attention because of their importance in the totalitarian countries. If a government monopolizes the radio, then by mere repetition and by the.r importance in the totalitarian countries. If a government monopolizes the radio, then by mere repetition and by RADIO 325 exclusion of conflicting points of view it can determine the opinions of the population. We do not know much about how this monopolistic effect really works,but it is important to note its singularity. No inference should be drawn regardign the effects of radio as such. It is often forgotten that Hitler did not achieve control through radio but almost despite it, because at the time of his rise to power radio was controlled by his enem.es. The monopolistic effects have probably less social importance than is generally assumed. Professor Lazarsfeld’s helpless unawareness of the nature and effects of radio is not a personal defect, but a universally shared ineptitude. In a radio speech in Munich, March 14, 1936, Hitler said “I go my way with the assurance of a somnambulist.” His victims and his critics have been equally somnambulistic. They danced entranced to the tribal drum of radio that extended their central nervous system to create depth involvement for everybody. “I live right inside radio when I listen. I more easily lose myself in radio than in a book,” said a voice from a radio poll. The power of radio to involve people in depth is manifested in its use during homework by youngsters and by many other people who carry transistor sets in order to provide a private world for themselves amidst crowds. There is a little poem by the German dramatist Berthold Brecht: You little box, held to me when escaping So that your valves should not break, Carried from house to ship from ship to train, So that my enemies might go on talking to me Near my bed, to my pain The last thing at night, the first thing in the morning, Of their victories and of my cares, Promise me not to go silent all of a sudden. One of the many effects of television on radio has been to shift radio from an entertainment medium into a kind of nervous information system. News bulletins, time signals, traffic data, and above all weather reports now serve to enhance the native power of radio to involve people in one another. Weather is that medium that involves all people equally. It is the top item on radio, showering us with fountains of auditory space or lebensraum. It was no accident that Senator McCarthy lasted such a very short time when he switched to TV. Soon the press decided, “He isn’t news any more.” Neither McCarthy nor the press ever knew what had happened. TV is a cool medium. It rejects hot figures and hot issues and people from the hot press media. Fred Allen was a casualty of TV Was Marilyn Monroe? Had TV occurred on a large scale during Hitler’s reign he would have vanished quickly. Had TV come first there would have been no Hitler at all. When Khrushchev appeared on American TV he was more acceptable than Nixon, as a clown and a lovable sort of old boy. His appearance is rendered by TV as a comic cartoon. Radio, however, is a hot medium and takes cartoon characters seriously. Mr. K. on radio would be a different proposition.

Since TV, children-regardless of eye condition –average about six and a half inches from the printed page. Our children are striving to carry over to the printed page the all-involving sensory mandate of the TV image. With perfect psycho-mimetic skill, they carry out the commands of the TV image. They pore, they probe, they slow down and involve themselves in depth. This is what they had learned to do in the cool iconography of the comic-book medium. TV carried the process much further. Suddenly they are transferred to the hot print medium with its uniform patterns and fast lineal movemnt. Pointlessly they strive to read print in depth. They bring to print all their senses, and print rejects them. Print asks for th isolated and stripped-down visual faculty, not for the unified sensorium. The Mackworth head-camera, when worn by children watching TV, has revealed that their eyes follow, not the actions, but the reactions. The eyes scarcely deviate from the faces of the actors, even during scenes of violence. This head-camera shows by projection both the scene and the eye movement simultaneously. Such extraordinary behavior is another indication of the very cool and involving character of this medium. On the Jack Paar show for March 8, 1963, Richard Nixon was Paared down and remade into a suitable TV image. It turns out that Mr. Nixon is both a pianist and a composer. With sure tact for the character of the TV medium, Jack Paar brought out this pianoforte side of Mr. Nixon, with excellent effect. Instead of the slick, glib, legal Nixon, we saw the doggedly creative and modest performer. A few timely touches like this would have quite altered the result of the Kennedy-Nixon campaign. TV is a medium that rejects the sharp personality and favors the presentation of processes rather than of products. The adaptation of TV to processes, rather than to the neatly packaged products, explains the frustration many people experience with this medium in its political uses. An article by Edith Efron in TV Guide (May 18-24, 1963) labeled TV “The Timid Giant,” because it is unsuited to hot issues and sharply defined controversal topics: “Despite official freedom from censorship, a self-imposed silence renders network documentaries almost mute on many great issues of the day.” As a cool medium TV has, some feel, introduced a kind of rigor mortis into the body politic. It is the extraordinary degree of audience participation in the TV medium that explains its failure to tackle hot issues. Howard K. Smith observed: “The networks are delighted if you go into a controversy in a country 14,000 miles away. They don’t want real controversy, real dissent, at home.” For people conditioned to the hot newspaper medium, which is concerned with the clash of views, rather than involvement in depth in a situation, the TV behavior is inexplicable. Such a hot news item that concerns TV directly was headlined “It finally happened –a British film with English subtitles to explain the dialects.” The film in question is the British comedy “Sparrows Don’t Sing.” A glossary of Yorkshire, Cockney, and other slang phrases has been printed for the customers so that they can figure out just what the subtitles mean. Sub subtitles are as handy an indicator of the depth effects of TV as the new “rugged” styles in feminine attire. One of the most extraordinary developments since TV in England has been the upsurge of regional dialects. A regional brogue or “burr” is the vocal equivalent of gaiter stockings. Such brogues undergo continual erosion from literacy. Their sudden prominence in England in areas in which previously one had heard only standard English is one of the most significant cultural events of our time. Even in the classrooms of Oxford and Cambridge, the local dialects are heard again.

Shunning the expertise of American astronauts, all of whom were qualified test pilots, the Russians don’t seem to feel that space travel is related enough to the airplane to require a pilot’s wings.” Since our culture forbids the sending of a woman into orbit, our only repartee would have been to launch into orbit a group of space children, to indicate that it is, after all, child’s play. The first sputnik or “little fellowtraveler” was a witty taunting of the capitalist world by means of a new kind of technological image or icon, for which a group of children in orbit might yet be a telling retort. Plainly, the first lady astronaut is offered to the West as a little Valentine heart to our sentimentality. In fact, the war of the icons, or the eroding of the collective countenance of one’s rivals, has long been under way. Ink and photo are supplanting soldiery and tanks. The pen daily becomes mightier than the sword. The French phrase “guerre des nerfs” of twenty-five years ago has since come to be referred to as “the cold war.” It is really an electric battle of information and of images that goes far deeper and is more obsessional than the old hot wars of industrial hardware. The “hot” wars of the past used weapons that knocked off the enemy, one by one. Even ideological warfare in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries proceeded by persuading individuals to adopt new points of view, one at a time. Electric persuasion by photo and movie and TV works, instead, by dunking entire populations in new imagery. Full awareness of this technological change had dawned on Madison Avenue ten years ago when it shifted its tactics from the promotion of the individual product to the collective involvement in the “corporate image,” now altered to “corporate posture.” Parallel to the new cold war of information exchange is the situation commented on by James Reston in a New York Times release from Washington: Politics has gone international. The British Labor Leader is here campaigning for Prime Minister of Britain, and fairly soon John F. Kennedy will be over in Italy and Germany campaigning for reelection. Everybody’s now whistle-stopping through somebody else’s country, usually ours. Washington has still not adjusted to this third-man role. It keeps forgetting that anything said here may be used by one side or another in some election campaign, and that it may, by accident, be the decisive element in the final vote. If the cold war in 1964 is being fought by informational tech- nology, that is because all wars have been fought by the latest technology available in any culture. In one of his sermons John Donne commented thankfully on the blessing of heavy firearms: So by the benefit of this light of reason they have found out Artillery, by which warres come to quicker ends than heretofore . . The scientific knowledge needed for the use of gunpowder and the boring of cannon appeared to Donne as “the light of reason.” He failed to notice another advance in the same technology that hastened and extended the scope of human slaughter. It is referred to by John U. Nef in War and Human Progress: The gradual abandonment of armor as a part of the equipment of soldiers during the seventeenth century freed some metal supplies for the manufacture of firearms and missiles. It is easy to discover in this a seamless web of interwoven events when we turn to look at the psychic and social consequences of the technological extensions of man. Back in the 1920s King Amanullah seems to have put his finger on this web when he said, after firing off a torpedo: “I feel half an Englishman already.” The same sense of the relentlessly interwoven texture of human fate was touched by the schoo","date":"2022-03-06","objectID":"/en/understanding_media/:2:25","tags":["媒体","media"],"title":"Understanding Media: The Extension","uri":"/en/understanding_media/"},{"categories":["媒体","media"],"content":"33 AUTOMATION: Learning a Living A newspaper headline recently read: “Little Red Schoolhouse Dies When Good Road built.” One-room schools, with all subjets being taught to all the same time, simply dissolve when better transportation permits specialized spaces and specialized teaching. At the extreme of speeded up movement, however, specialism fo sapce adn subject disappears once more. With automation, it is not only jobs that siappear, and complex roles that reappear. Centuries fo specialist stress in pedagogy and inthe arrangemnt of of data now end with the instantaneous retrieval of information made possible by electricity. Automation is information and it not only ends jobs in the world of work, it ends subjects in the world of learning. It does not end the world of learning. The future of work consists of earning a living in the automation age. This is a familiar pattern in electric technology in general. It ends the old dichotomies between culture and technology, between art and commerce, and between work and leisure. Whereas in the mechanical age of fragmentation leisure had been the absence of work, or mere idleness, the reverse is true in the electric age. As the age of information demands the simultaneous use of all our faculties, we discover that we are most at leisure when we are most intensely involved, very much as with the artists in all ages. In terms of the industrial age, it can be pointed out that the difference between the previous mechanical age and the new electric age appears in the different kinds of inventories. Since electricity, inventories are made up not so much of goods in storage as of materials in continuous process of transformation at spatially removed sites. For electricity not only gives primacy to process, whether in making or in learning, but it makes independent the source of energy from the location of the process. In entertainment media, we speak of this fact as “mass media” because the source of the program and the process of experiencing it are independent in space, yet simultaneous in time. In industry this basic fact causes the scientific revolution that is called “automation” or “cybernation.” In education the conventional division of the curriculum into subjects is already as outdated as the medieval trivium and quadrivium after the Renaissance. Any subject taken in depth at once relates to other subjects. Arithmetic in grade three or nine, when taught in terms of number theory, symbolic logic, and cultural history, ceases to be mere practice in problems. Continued in their present patterns of fragmented unrelation, our school curricula will insure a citizenry unable to understand the cybernated world in which they live. Most scientists are quite aware that since we have acquired some knowledge of electricity it is not possible to speak of atoms as pieces of matter. Again, as more is known about electrical “discharges” and energy, there is less and less tendency to speak of electricity as a thing that “flows” like water through a wire, or is “contained” in a battery. Rather, the tendency is to speak of electricity as painters speak of space; namely, that it is a variable condition that involves the special positions of two or more bodies. There is no longer any tendency to speak of electricity as “contained” in anything. Painters have long known that objects are not contained in space, but that they generate their own spaces. It was the dawning awareness of this in the mathematical world a century ago that enabled Lewis Carroll, the Oxford mathematician, to contrive Alice in Wonderland, in which times, and spaces are neither uniform nor continuous, as they had seemed to be since the arrival of Renaissance perspective. As for the speed of light, that is merely the speed of total causality. It is a principal aspect of the electric age that it establishes a global network that has much of the character of our central nervous system.

Empirical research into how we learn and remember shows that much of what we take for gospel about how to learn turns out to be largely wasted effort. Even college and medical students—whose main job is learning—rely on study techniques that are far from optimal. At the same time, this field of research, which goes back 125 years but has been particularly fruitful in recent years, has yielded a body of insights that constitute a growing science of learning: highly effective, evidence-based strategies to replace less effective but widely accepted practices that are rooted in theory, lore, and intuition. But there’s a catch: the most effective learning strategies are not intuitive. Two of us, Henry Roediger and Mark McDaniel, are cognitive scientists who have dedicated our careers to the study of learning and memory. Peter Brown is a storyteller. We have teamed up to explain how learning and memory work, and we do this less by reciting the research than by telling stories of people who have found their way to mastery of complex knowledge and skills. Through these examples we illuminate the principles of learning that the research shows are highly effective. This book arose in part from a collaboration among eleven cognitive psychologists. In 2002, the James S. McDonnell Foundation of St. Louis, Missouri, in an effort to better bridge the gap between basic knowledge on learning in cognitive psychology and its application in education, awarded a research grant “Applying Cognitive Psychology to Enhance Educational Practice” to Roediger and McDaniel and nine others, with Roediger as the principal investigator. The team collaborated for ten years on research to translate cognitive science into educational science, and in many respects this book is a direct result of that work. The researchers and many of their studies are cited in the book, the notes, and our acknowledgments. Roediger’s and McDaniel’s work is also supported by several other funders, and McDaniel is the co-director of Washington University’s Center for Integrative Research in Learning and Memory. Most books deal with topics serially—they cover one topic, move on to the next, and so on. We follow this strategy in the sense that each chapter addresses new topics, but we also apply two of the primary learning principles in the book: spaced repetition of key ideas, and the interleaving of different but related topics. If learners spread out their study of a topic, returning to it periodically over time, they remember it better. Similarly, if they interleave the study of different topics, they learn each better than if they had studied them one at a time in sequence. Thus we unabashedly cover key ideas more than once, repeating principles in different contexts across the book. The reader will remember them better and use them more effectively as a result. This is a book about what people can do for themselves right now in order to learn better and remember longer. The responsibility for learning rests with every individual. Teachers and coaches, too, can be more effective right now by helping students understand these principles and by designing them into the learning experience. This is not a book about how education policy or the school system ought to be reformed. Clearly, though, there are policy implications. For example, college professors at the forefront of applying these strategies in the classroom have experimented with their potential for narrowing the achievement gap in the sciences, and the results of those studies are eye opening. We write for students and teachers, of course, and for all readers for whom effective learning is a high priority: for trainers in business, industry, and the military; for leaders of professional associations offering in-service training to their members; and for coaches.

He was alone, flying through the night at eleven thousand feet, making a hotshot freight run to a plant in Kentucky that had shut down its manufacturing line awaiting product parts for assembly. He reduced altitude and kept an eye on the oil gauge, hoping to fly as far as a planned fuel stop in Louisiana, where he could service the plane, but the pressure kept falling. Matt has been messing around with piston engines since he was old enough to hold a wrench, and he knew he had a problem. He ran a mental checklist, figuring his options. If he let the oil pressure get too low he risked the engine’s seizing up. How much further could he fly before shutting it down? What would happen when he did? He’d lose lift on the right side, but could he stay aloft? He reviewed the tolerances he’d memorized for the Cessna 401. Loaded, the best you could do on one engine was slow your descent. But he had a light load, and he’d burned through most of his fuel. So he shut down the ailing right engine, feathered the prop to reduce drag, increased power on the left, flew with opposite rudder, and limped another ten miles toward his intended stop. There, he made his approach in a wide left-hand turn, for the simple but critical reason that without power on his right side it was only from a left-hand turn that he still had the lift needed to level out for a touchdown. While we don’t need to understand each of the actions Matt took, he certainly needed to, and his ability to work himself out of a jam illustrates what we mean in this book when we talk about learning: we mean acquiring knowledge and skills and having them readily available from memory so you can make sense of future problems and opportunities. There are some immutable aspects of learning that we can probably all agree on: First, to be useful, learning requires memory, so what we’ve learned is still there later when we need it. Second, we need to keep learning and remembering all our lives. We can’t advance through middle school without some mastery of language arts, math, science, and social studies. Getting ahead at work takes mastery of job skills and difficult colleagues. In retirement, we pick up new interests. In our dotage, we move into simpler housing while we’re still able to adapt. If you’re good at learning, you have an advantage in life. Third, learning is an acquired skill, and the most effective strategies are often counterintuitive.

Here, more or less unadorned in list form, are some of the principal claims we make in support of our argument. We set them forth more fully in the chapters that follow. Learning is deeper and more durable when it’s effortful. Learning that’s easy is like writing in sand, here today and gone tomorrow. We are poor judges of when we are learning well and when we’re not. When the going is harder and slower and it doesn’t feel productive, we are drawn to strategies that feel more fruitful, unaware that the gains from these strategies are often temporary. Rereading text and massed practice of a skill or new knowledge are by far the preferred study strategies of learners of all stripes, but they’re also among the least productive. By massed practice we mean the single-minded, rapid-fire repetition of something you’re trying to burn into memory, the “practice-practice-practice” of conventional wisdom. Cramming for exams is an example. Rereading and massed practice give rise to feelings of fluency that are taken to be signs of mastery, but for true mastery or durability these strategies are largely a waste of time. Retrieval practice—recalling facts or concepts or events from memory—is a more effective learning strategy than review by rereading. Flashcards are a simple example. Retrieval strengthens the memory and interrupts forgetting. A single, simple quiz after reading a text or hearing a lecture produces better learning and remembering than rereading the text or reviewing lecture notes. While the brain is not a muscle that gets stronger with exercise, the neural pathways that make up a body of learning do get stronger, when the memory is retrieved and the learning is practiced. Periodic practice arrests forgetting, strengthens retrieval routes, and is essential for hanging onto the knowledge you want to gain. When you space out practice at a task and get a little rusty between sessions, or you interleave the practice of two or more subjects, retrieval is harder and feels less productive, but the effort produces longer lasting learning and enables more versatile application of it in later settings. Trying to solve a problem before being taught the solution leads to better learning, even when errors are made in the attempt. The popular notion that you learn better when you receive instruction in a form consistent with your preferred learning style, for example as an auditory or visual learner, is not supported by the empirical research. People do have multiple forms of intelligence to bring to bear on learning, and you learn better when you “go wide,” drawing on all of your aptitudes and resourcefulness, than when you limit instruction or experience to the style you find most amenable. When you’re adept at extracting the underlying principles or “rules” that differentiate types of problems, you’re more successful at picking the right solutions in unfamiliar situations. This skill is better acquired through interleaved and varied practice than massed practice. For instance, interleaving practice at computing the volumes of different kinds of geometric solids makes you more skilled at picking the right solution when a later test presents a random solid. Interleaving the identification of bird types or the works of oil painters improves your ability both to learn the unifying attributes within a type and to differentiate between types, improving your skill at categorizing new specimens you encounter later. We’re all susceptible to illusions that can hijack our judgment of what we know and can do. Testing helps calibrate our judgments of what we’ve learned. A pilot who is responding to a failure of hydraulic systems in a flight simulator discovers quickly whether he’s on top of the corrective procedures or not. In virtually all areas of learning, you build better mastery when you use testing as a tool to identify and bring up your areas","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:2:1","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Empirical Evidence versus Theory, Lore, and Intuition Much of how we structure training and schooling is based on learning theories that have been handed down to us, and these are shaped by our own sense of what works, a sensibility drawn from our personal experiences as teachers, coaches, students, and mere humans at large on the earth. How we teach and study is largely a mix of theory, lore, and intuition. But over the last forty years and more, cognitive psychologists have been working to build a body of evidence to clarify what works and to discover the strategies that get results. Cognitive psychology is the basic science of understanding how the mind works, conducting empirical research into how people perceive, remember, and think. Many others have their hands in the puzzle of learning as well. Developmental and educational psychologists are concerned with theories of human development and how they can be used to shape the tools of education—such as testing regimes, instructional organizers (for example topic outlines and schematic illustrations), and resources for special groups like those in remedial and gifted education. Neuroscientists, using new imaging techniques and other tools, are advancing our understanding of brain mechanisms that underlie learning, but we’re still a very long way from knowing what neuroscience will tell us about how to improve education. How is one to know whose advice to take on how best to go about learning? It’s wise to be skeptical. Advice is easy to find, only a few mouse-clicks away. Yet not all advice is grounded in research—far from it. Nor does all that passes as research meet the standards of science, such as having appropriate control conditions to assure that the results of an investigation are objective and generalizable. The best empirical studies are experimental in nature: the researcher develops a hypothesis and then tests it through a set of experiments that must meet rigorous criteria for design and objectivity. In the chapters that follow, we have distilled the findings of a large body of such studies that have stood up under review by the scientific community before being published in professional journals. We are collaborators in some of these studies, but not the lion’s share. Where we’re offering theory rather than scientifically validated results, we say so. To make our points we use, in addition to tested science, anecdotes from people like Matt Brown whose work requires mastery of complex knowledge and skills, stories that illustrate the underlying principles of how we learn and remember. Discussion of the research studies themselves is kept to a minimum, but you will find many of them cited in the notes at the end of the book if you care to dig further. People Misunderstand Learning It turns out that much of what we’ve been doing as teachers and students isn’t serving us well, but some comparatively simple changes could make a big difference. People commonly believe that if you expose yourself to something enough times—say, a textbook passage or a set of terms from an eighth grade biology class—you can burn it into memory. Not so. Many teachers believe that if they can make learning easier and faster, the learning will be better. Much research turns this belief on its head: when learning is harder, it’s stronger and lasts longer. It’s widely believed by teachers, trainers, and coaches that the most effective way to master a new skill is to give it dogged, single-minded focus, practicing over and over until you’ve got it down. Our faith in this runs deep, because most of us see fast gains during the learning phase of massed practice. What’s apparent from the research is that gains achieved during massed practice are transitory and melt away quickly. The finding that rereading textbooks is often labor in vain ought to send a chill up the spines of educators and learners, because it’s the number one study strategy of most people—including more than 80 percent of coll","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:2:2","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Knowledge: Not Sufficient, but Necessary Albert Einstein declared “creativity is more important than knowledge,” and the sentiment appears to be widely shared by college students, if their choice in t-shirt proclamations is any indication. And why wouldn’t they seize on the sentiment? It embodies an obvious and profound truth, for without creativity where would our scientific, social, or economic breakthroughs come from? Besides which, accumulating knowledge can feel like a grind, while creativity sounds like a lot more fun. But of course the dichotomy is false. You wouldn’t want to see that t-shirt on your neurosurgeon or on the captain who’s flying your plane across the Pacific. But the sentiment has gained some currency as a reaction to standardized testing, fearing that this kind of testing leads to an emphasis on memorization at the expense of high-level skills. Notwithstanding the pitfalls of standardized testing, what we really ought to ask is how to do better at building knowledge and creativity, for without knowledge you don’t have the foundation for the higher-level skills of analysis, synthesis, and creative problem solving. As the psychologist Robert Sternberg and two colleagues put it, “one cannot apply what one knows in a practical manner if one does not know anything to apply.”12 Mastery in any field, from cooking to chess to brain surgery, is a gradual accretion of knowledge, conceptual understanding, judgment, and skill. These are the fruits of variety in the practice of new skills, and of striving, reflection, and mental rehearsal. Memorizing facts is like stocking a construction site with the supplies to put up a house. Building the house requires not only knowledge of countless different fittings and materials but conceptual understanding, too, of aspects like the load-bearing properties of a header or roof truss system, or the principles of energy transfer and conservation that will keep the house warm but the roof deck cold so the owner doesn’t call six months later with ice dam problems. Mastery requires both the possession of ready knowledge and the conceptual understanding of how to use it. When Matt Brown had to decide whether or not to kill his right engine he was problem solving, and he needed to know from memory the procedures for flying with a dead engine and the tolerances of his plane in order to predict whether he would fall out of the air or be unable to straighten up for landing. The would-be neurosurgeon in her first year of med school has to memorize the whole nervous system, the whole skeletal system, the whole muscular system, the humeral system. If she can’t, she’s not going to be a neurosurgeon. Her success will depend on diligence, of course, but also on finding study strategies that will enable her to learn the sheer volume of material required in the limited hours available.

The growing focus over recent years on standardized assessment, in particular, has turned testing into a lightning rod for frustration over how to achieve the country’s education goals. Online forums and news articles are besieged by readers who charge that emphasis on testing favors memorization at the expense of a larger grasp of context or creative ability; that testing creates extra stress for students and gives a false measure of ability; and so on. But if we stop thinking of testing as a dipstick to measure learning—if we think of it as practicing retrieval of learning from memory rather than “testing,” we open ourselves to another possibility: the use of testing as a tool for learning. One of the most striking research findings is the power of active retrieval—testing—to strengthen memory, and that the more effortful the retrieval, the stronger the benefit. Think flight simulator versus PowerPoint lecture. Think quiz versus rereading. The act of retrieving learning from memory has two profound benefits. One, it tells you what you know and don’t know, and therefore where to focus further study to improve the areas where you’re weak. Two, recalling what you have learned causes your brain to reconsolidate the memory, which strengthens its connections to what you already know and makes it easier for you to recall in the future. In effect, retrieval—testing—interrupts forgetting. Consider an eighth grade science class. For the class in question, at a middle school in Columbia, Illinois, researchers arranged for part of the material covered during the course to be the subject of low-stakes quizzing (with feedback) at three points in the semester. Another part of the material was never quizzed but was studied three times in review. In a test a month later, which material was better recalled? The students averaged A- on the material that was quizzed and C+ on the material that was not quizzed but reviewed.13 In Matt Brown’s case, even after ten years piloting the same business jet, his employer reinforces his mastery every six months in a battery of tests and flight simulations that require him to retrieve the information and maneuvers that are essential to stay in control of his plane. As Matt points out, you hardly ever have an emergency, so if you don’t practice what to do, there’s no way to keep it fresh. Both of these cases—the research in the classroom and the experience of Matt Brown in updating his knowledge—point to the critical role of retrieval practice in keeping our knowledge accessible to us when we need it.

A great deal of what we think we know about how to learn is taken on faith and based on intuition but does not hold up under empirical research. Persistent illusions of knowing lead us to labor at unproductive strategies; as recounted in Chapter 3 , this is true even of people who have participated in empirical studies and seen the evidence for themselves, firsthand. Illusions are potent persuaders. One of the best habits a learner can instill in herself is regular self-quizzing to recalibrate her understanding of what she does and does not know. Second Lieutenant Kiley Hunkler, a 2013 graduate of West Point and winner of a Rhodes Scholarship, whom we write about in Chapter 8 , uses the phrase “shooting an azimuth” to describe how she takes practice tests to help refocus her studying. In overland navigation, shooting an azimuth means climbing to a height, sighting an object on the horizon in the direction you’re traveling, and adjusting your compass heading to make sure you’re still gaining on your objective as you beat through the forest below. The good news is that we now know of simple and practical strategies that anybody can use, at any point in life, to learn better and remember longer: various forms of retrieval practice, such as low-stakes quizzing and self-testing, spacing out practice, interleaving the practice of different but related topics or skills, trying to solve a problem before being taught the solution, distilling the underlying principles or rules that differentiate types of problems, and so on. In the chapters that follow we describe these in depth. And because learning is an iterative process that requires that you revisit what you have learned earlier and continually update it and connect it with new knowledge, we circle through these topics several times along the way. At the end, in Chapter 8 , we pull it all together with specific tips and examples for putting these tools to work. 2 To Learn, Retrieve MIKE EBERSOLD GOT CALLED into a hospital emergency room one afternoon late in 2011 to examine a Wisconsin deer hunter who’d been found lying unconscious in a cornfield. The man had blood at the back of his head, and the men who’d found and brought him in supposed he’d maybe stumbled and cracked his skull on something. Ebersold is a neurosurgeon. The injury had brain protruding, and he recognized it as a gunshot wound. The hunter regained consciousness in the ER, but when asked how he’d hurt himself, he had no idea. Recounting the incident later, Ebersold said, “Somebody from some distance away must have fired what appeared to be a 12-gauge shotgun, which arced over God only knows what distance, hit this guy in the back of his head, fractured his skull, and lodged into the brain about an inch. It must have been pretty much spent, or it would have gone deeper.”1 Ebersold is tall, slender, and counts among his forebears the Dakota chiefs named Wapasha and the French fur traders named Rocque who populated this part of the Mississippi River Valley where the Mayo brothers would later found their famous clinic. Ebersold’s formal training included four years of college, four years of medical school, and seven years of neurosurgery training—building a foundation of knowledge and skills that has been broadened and deepened through continuing medical education classes, consultations with his colleagues, and his practice at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere. He carries himself with a midwestern modesty that belies a career that counts a long list of high-profile patients who have sought out his services. When President Ronald Reagan needed treatment for injuries after a fall from his horse, Ebersold participated in the surgery and postsurgical care.

In neurosurgery (and, arguably, in all aspects of life from the moment you leave the womb), there’s an essential kind of learning that comes from reflection on personal experience. Ebersold described it this way: A lot of times something would come up in surgery that I had difficulty with, and then I’d go home that night thinking about what happened and what could I do, for example, to improve the way a suturing went. How can I take a bigger bite with my needle, or a smaller bite, or should the stitches be closer together? What if I modified it this way or that way? Then the next day back, I’d try that and see if it worked better. Or even if it wasn’t the next day, at least I’ve thought through this, and in so doing I’ve not only revisited things that I learned from lectures or from watching others performing surgery but also I’ve complemented that by adding something of my own to it that I missed during the teaching process. Reflection can involve several cognitive activities that lead to stronger learning: retrieving knowledge and earlier training from memory, connecting these to new experiences, and visualizing and mentally rehearsing what you might do differently next time. It was this kind of reflection that originally had led Ebersold to try a new technique for repairing the sinus vein at the back of the head, a technique he practiced in his mind and in the operating room until it became the kind of reflexive maneuver you can depend on when your patient is spouting blood at two hundred cubic centimeters a minute. To make sure the new learning is available when it’s needed, Ebersold points out, “you memorize the list of things that you need to worry about in a given situation: steps A, B, C, and D,” and you drill on them. Then there comes a time when you get into a tight situation and it’s no longer a matter of thinking through the steps, it’s a matter of reflexively taking the correct action. “Unless you keep recalling this maneuver, it will not become a reflex. Like a race car driver in a tight situation or a quarterback dodging a tackle, you’ve got to act out of reflex before you’ve even had time to think. Recalling it over and over, practicing it over and over. That’s just so important.” ","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:6:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"The Testing Effect A child stringing cranberries on a thread goes to hang them on the tree, only to find they’ve slipped off the other end. Without the knot, there’s no making a string. Without the knot there’s no necklace, there’s no beaded purse, no magnificent tapestry. Retrieval ties the knot for memory. Repeated retrieval snugs it up and adds a loop to make it fast. Since as far back as 1885, psychologists have been plotting “forgetting curves” that illustrate just how fast our cranberries slip off the string. In very short order we lose something like 70 percent of what we’ve just heard or read. After that, forgetting begins to slow, and the last 30 percent or so falls away more slowly, but the lesson is clear: a central challenge to improving the way we learn is finding a way to interrupt the process of forgetting.2 The power of retrieval as a learning tool is known among psychologists as the testing effect. In its most common form, testing is used to measure learning and assign grades in school, but we’ve long known that the act of retrieving knowledge from memory has the effect of making that knowledge easier to call up again in the future. In his essay on memory, Aristotle wrote: “exercise in repeatedly recalling a thing strengthens the memory.” Francis Bacon wrote about this phenomenon, as did the psychologist William James. Today, we know from empirical research that practicing retrieval makes learning stick far better than reexposure to the original material does. This is the testing effect, also known as the retrieval-practice effect.3 To be most effective, retrieval must be repeated again and again, in spaced out sessions so that the recall, rather than becoming a mindless recitation, requires some cognitive effort. Repeated recall appears to help memory consolidate into a cohesive representation in the brain and to strengthen and multiply the neural routes by which the knowledge can later be retrieved. In recent decades, studies have confirmed what Mike Ebersold and every seasoned quarterback, jet pilot, and teenaged texter knows from experience—that repeated retrieval can so embed knowledge and skills that they become reflexive: the brain acts before the mind has time to think. Yet despite what research and personal experience tell us about the power of testing as a learning tool, teachers and students in traditional educational settings rarely use it as such, and the technique remains little understood or utilized by teachers or students as a learning tool in traditional educational settings. Far from it. In 2010 the New York Times reported on a scientific study that showed that students who read a passage of text and then took a test asking them to recall what they had read retained an astonishing 50 percent more of the information a week later than students who had not been tested. This would seem like good news, but here’s how it was greeted in many online comments: “Once again, another author confuses learning with recalling information.” “I personally would like to avoid as many tests as possible, especially with my grade on the line. Trying to learn in a stressful environment is no way to help retain information.” “Nobody should care whether memorization is enhanced by practice testing or not. Our children cannot do much of anything anymore.”4 Forget memorization, many commenters argued; education should be about high-order skills. Hmmm. If memorization is irrelevant to complex problem solving, don’t tell your neurosurgeon. The frustration many people feel toward standardized, “dipstick” tests given for the sole purpose of measuring learning is understandable, but it steers us away from appreciating one of the most potent learning tools available to us. Pitting the learning of basic knowledge against the development of creative thinking is a false choice. Both need to be cultivated.

The first large-scale investigation was published in 1917. Children in grades 3, 5, 6, and 8 studied brief biographies from Who’s Who in America. Some of them were directed to spend varying lengths of the study time looking up from the material and silently reciting to themselves what it contained. Those who did not do so simply continued to reread the material. At the end of the period, all the children were asked to write down what they could remember. The recall test was repeated three to four hours later. All the groups who had engaged in the recitation showed better retention than those who had not done so but had merely continued to review the material. The best results were from those spending about 60 percent of the study time in recitation. A second landmark study, published in 1939, tested over three thousand sixth graders across Iowa. The kids studied six-hundred-word articles and then took tests at various times before a final test two months later. The experiment showed a couple of interesting results: the longer the first test was delayed, the greater the forgetting, and second, once a student had taken a test, the forgetting nearly stopped, and the student’s score on subsequent tests dropped very little.5 Around 1940, interest turned to the study of forgetting, and investigating the potential of testing as a form of retrieval practice and as a learning tool fell out of favor. So did the use of testing as a research tool: since testing interrupts forgetting, you can’t use it to measure forgetting because that “contaminates” the subject. Interest in the testing effect resurfaced in 1967 with the publication of a study showing that research subjects who were presented with lists of thirty-six words learned as much from repeated testing after initial exposure to the words as they did from repeated studying. These results—that testing led to as much learning as studying did—challenged the received wisdom, turned researchers’ attention back to the potential of testing as a learning tool, and stimulated a boomlet in testing research. In 1978, researchers found that massed studying (cramming) leads to higher scores on an immediate test but results in faster forgetting compared to practicing retrieval. In a second test two days after an initial test, the crammers had forgotten 50 percent of what they had been able to recall on the initial test, while those who had spent the same period practicing retrieval instead of studying had forgotten only 13 percent of the information recalled initially. A subsequent study was aimed at understanding what effect taking multiple tests would have on subjects’ long-term retention. Students heard a story that named sixty concrete objects. Those students who were tested immediately after exposure recalled 53 percent of the objects on this initial test but only 39 percent a week later. On the other hand, a group of students who learned the same material but were not tested at all until a week later recalled 28 percent. Thus, taking a single test boosted performance by 11 percent after a week. But what effect would three immediate tests have relative to one? Another group of students were tested three times after initial exposure and a week later they were able to recall 53 percent of the objects—the same as on the initial test for the group receiving one test. In effect, the group that received three tests had been “immunized” against forgetting, compared to the one-test group, and the one-test group remembered more than those who had received no test immediately following exposure. Thus, and in agreement with later research, multiple sessions of retrieval practice are generally better than one, especially if the test sessions are spaced out.6 In another study, researchers showed that simply asking a subject to fill in a word’s missing letters resulted in better memory of the word.

The positive effects of retrieval practice had been demonstrated many times in controlled laboratory settings but rarely in a regular classroom setting. Would the principal, teachers, kids, and parents of Columbia Middle School be willing subjects in a study to see how the testing effect would work “in the wild”? Chamberlain had concerns. If this was just about memorization, he wasn’t especially interested. His aim is to raise the school’s students to higher forms of learning—analysis, synthesis, and application, as he put it. And he was concerned about his teachers, an energetic faculty with curricula and varied instructional methods he was loath to disrupt. On the other hand, the study’s results could be instructive, and participation would bring enticements in the form of smart boards and “clickers”—automated response systems—for the classrooms of participating teachers. Money for new technology is famously tight. A sixth grade social studies teacher, Patrice Bain, was eager to give it a try. For the researchers, a chance to work in the classroom was compelling, and the school’s terms were accepted: the study would be minimally intrusive by fitting within existing curricula, lesson plans, test formats, and teaching methods. The same textbooks would be used. The only difference in the class would be the introduction of occasional short quizzes. The study would run for three semesters (a year and a half), through several chapters of the social studies textbook, covering topics such as ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, and China. The project was launched in 2006. It would prove to be a good decision. For the six social studies classes a research assistant, Pooja Agarwal, designed a series of quizzes that would test students on roughly one-third of the material covered by the teacher. These quizzes were for “no stakes,” meaning that scores were not counted toward a grade. The teacher excused herself from the classroom for each quiz so as to remain unaware of which material was being tested. One quiz was given at the start of class, on material from assigned reading that hadn’t yet been discussed. A second was given at the end of class after the teacher had covered the material for the day’s lesson. And a review quiz was given twenty-four hours before each unit exam. There was concern that if students tested better in the final exam on material that had been quizzed than on material not quizzed, it could be argued that the simple act of reexposing them to the material in the quizzes was responsible for the superior learning, not the retrieval practice. To counter this possibility, some of the nonquizzed material was interspersed with the quiz material, provided as simple review statements, like “The Nile River has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile,” with no retrieval required. The facts were quizzed for some classes but just restudied for others. The quizzes took only a few minutes of classroom time. After the teacher stepped out of the room, Agarwal projected a series of slides onto the board at the front of the room and read them to the students. Each slide presented either a multiple choice question or a statement of fact. When the slide contained a question, students used clickers (handheld, cell-phone-like remotes) to indicate their answer choice: A, B, C, or D. When all had responded, the correct answer was revealed, so as to provide feedback and correct errors. (Although teachers were not present for these quizzes, under normal circumstances, with teachers administering quizzes, they would see immediately how well students are tracking the study material and use the results to guide further discussion or study.) Unit exams were the normal pencil-and-paper tests given by the teacher. Exams were also given at the end o","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:9:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Exploring Nuances Andy Sobel’s example is anecdotal and likely reflects a variety of beneficial influences, not least being the cumulative learning effects that accrue like compounded interest when course material is carried forward in a regime of quizzes across an entire semester. Nonetheless, his experience squares with empirical research designed to tease apart the effects and nuances of testing. For example, in one experiment college students studied prose passages on various scientific topics like those taught in college and then either took an immediate recall test after the initial exposure or restudied the material. After a delay of two days, the students who took the initial test recalled more of the material than those who simply restudied it (68 v. 54 percent), and this advantage was sustained a week later (56 v. 42 percent). Another experiment found that after one week a study-only group showed the most forgetting of what they initially had been able to recall, forgetting 52 percent, compared to a repeated-testing group, who forgot only 10 percent.11 How does giving feedback on wrong answers to test questions affect learning? Studies show that giving feedback strengthens retention more than testing alone does, and, interestingly, some evidence shows that delaying the feedback briefly produces better long-term learning than immediate feedback. This finding is counterintuitive but is consistent with researchers’ discoveries about how we learn motor tasks, like making layups or driving a golf ball toward a distant green. In motor learning, trial and error with delayed feedback is a more awkward but effective way of acquiring a skill than trial and correction through immediate feedback; immediate feedback is like the training wheels on a bicycle: the learner quickly comes to depend on the continued presence of the correction. In the case of learning motor skills, one theory holds that when there’s immediate feedback it comes to be part of the task, so that later, in a real-world setting, its absence becomes a gap in the established pattern that disrupts performance. Another idea holds that frequent interruptions for feedback make the learning sessions too variable, preventing establishment of a stabilized pattern of performance.12 In the classroom, delayed feedback also yields better long-term learning than immediate feedback does. In the case of the students studying prose passages on science topics, some were shown the passage again even while they were asked to answer questions about it, in effect providing them with continuous feedback during the test, analogous to an open-book exam. The other group took the test without the study material at hand and only afterward were given the passage and instructed to look over their responses. Of course, the open-book group performed best on the immediate test, but those who got corrective feedback after completing the test retained the learning better on a later test. Delayed feedback on written tests may help because it gives the student practice that’s spaced out in time; as discussed in the next chapter, spacing practice improves retention.13 Are some kinds of retrieval practice more effective for long-term learning than others? Tests that require the learner to supply the answer, like an essay or short-answer test, or simply practice with flashcards, appear to be more effective than simple recognition tests like multiple choice or true/false tests. However, even multiple choice tests like those used at Columbia Middle School can yield strong benefits. While any kind of retrieval practice generally benefits learning, the implication seems to be that where more cognitive effort is required for retrieval, greater retention results. Retrieval practice has been studied extensively in recent years, and an analysis of these studies shows that even a single test in a class can produce a large improvement in final exam scores, and gains in learning continue to increase as the num","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:10:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"The Takeaway Practice at retrieving new knowledge or skill from memory is a potent tool for learning and durable retention. This is true for anything the brain is asked to remember and call up again in the future—facts, complex concepts, problem-solving techniques, motor skills. Effortful retrieval makes for stronger learning and retention. We’re easily seduced into believing that learning is better when it’s easier, but the research shows the opposite: when the mind has to work, learning sticks better. The greater the effort to retrieve learning, provided that you succeed, the more that learning is strengthened by retrieval. After an initial test, delaying subsequent retrieval practice is more potent for reinforcing retention than immediate practice, because delayed retrieval requires more effort. Repeated retrieval not only makes memories more durable but produces knowledge that can be retrieved more readily, in more varied settings, and applied to a wider variety of problems. While cramming can produce better scores on an immediate exam, the advantage quickly fades because there is much greater forgetting after rereading than after retrieval practice. The benefits of retrieval practice are long-term. Simply including one test (retrieval practice) in a class yields a large improvement in final exam scores, and gains continue to increase as the frequency of classroom testing increases. Testing doesn’t need to be initiated by the instructor. Students can practice retrieval anywhere; no quizzes in the classroom are necessary. Think flashcards—the way second graders learn the multiplication tables can work just as well for learners at any age to quiz themselves on anatomy, mathematics, or law. Self-testing may be unappealing because it takes more effort than rereading, but as noted already, the greater the effort at retrieval, the more will be retained. Students who take practice tests have a better grasp of their progress than those who simply reread the material. Similarly, such testing enables an instructor to spot gaps and misconceptions and adapt instruction to correct them. Giving students corrective feedback after tests keeps them from incorrectly retaining material they have misunderstood and produces better learning of the correct answers. Students in classes that incorporate low-stakes quizzing come to embrace the practice. Students who are tested frequently rate their classes more favorably. What about Principal Roger Chamberlain’s initial concerns about practice quizzing at Columbia Middle School—that it might be nothing more than a glorified path to rote learning? When we asked him this question after the study was completed, he paused for a moment to gather his thoughts. “What I’ve really gained a comfort level with is this: for kids to be able to evaluate, synthesize, and apply a concept in different settings, they’re going to be much more efficient at getting there when they have the base of knowledge and the retention, so they’re not wasting time trying to go back and figure out what that word might mean or what that concept was about. It allows them to go to a higher level.” 3 Mix Up Your Practice IT MAY NOT BE INTUITIVE that retrieval practice is a more powerful learning strategy than repeated review and rereading, yet most of us take for granted the importance of testing in sports. It’s what we call “practice-practice-practice.” Well, here’s a study that may surprise you. A group of eight-year-olds practiced tossing beanbags into buckets in gym class. Half of the kids tossed into a bucket three feet away. The other half mixed it up by tossing into buckets two feet and four feet away. After twelve weeks of this they were all tested on tossing into a three-foot bucket. The kids who did the best by far were those who’d practiced on two- and four-foot buckets but never on three-foot buckets.1 Why is this? We will come back to the beanbags, but first a little insight into a widely held myth about how we learn.

Faith in focused, repetitive practice of one thing at a time until we’ve got it nailed is pervasive among classroom teachers, athletes, corporate trainers, and students. Researchers call this kind of practice “massed,” and our faith rests in large part on the simple fact that when we do it, we can see it making a difference. Nevertheless, despite what our eyes tell us, this faith is misplaced. If learning can be defined as picking up new knowledge or skills and being able to apply them later, then how quickly you pick something up is only part of the story. Is it still there when you need to use it out in the everyday world? While practicing is vital to learning and memory, studies have shown that practice is far more effective when it’s broken into separate periods of training that are spaced out. The rapid gains produced by massed practice are often evident, but the rapid forgetting that follows is not. Practice that’s spaced out, interleaved with other learning, and varied produces better mastery, longer retention, and more versatility. But these benefits come at a price: when practice is spaced, interleaved, and varied, it requires more effort. You feel the increased effort, but not the benefits the effort produces. Learning feels slower from this kind of practice, and you don’t get the rapid improvements and affirmations you’re accustomed to seeing from massed practice. Even in studies where the participants have shown superior results from spaced learning, they don’t perceive the improvement; they believe they learned better on the material where practice was massed. Almost everywhere you look, you find examples of massed practice: summer language boot camps, colleges that offer concentration in a single subject with the promise of fast learning, continuing education seminars for professionals where training is condensed into a single weekend. Cramming for exams is a form of massed practice. It feels like a productive strategy, and it may get you through the next day’s midterm, but most of the material will be long forgotten by the time you sit down for the final. Spacing out your practice feels less productive for the very reason that some forgetting has set in and you’ve got to work harder to recall the concepts. It doesn’t feel like you’re on top of it. What you don’t sense in the moment is that this added effort is making the learning stronger.2 ","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:12:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Spaced Practice The benefits of spacing out practice sessions are long established, but for a vivid example consider this study of thirty-eight surgical residents. They took a series of four short lessons in microsurgery: how to reattach tiny vessels. Each lesson included some instruction followed by some practice. Half the docs completed all four lessons in a single day, which is the normal in-service schedule. The others completed the same four lessons but with a week’s interval between them.3 In a test given a month after their last session, those whose lessons had been spaced a week apart outperformed their colleagues in all areas—elapsed time to complete a surgery, number of hand movements, and success at reattaching the severed, pulsating aortas of live rats. The difference in performance between the two groups was impressive. The residents who had taken all four sessions in a single day not only scored lower on all measures, but 16 percent of them damaged the rats’ vessels beyond repair and were unable to complete their surgeries. Why is spaced practice more effective than massed practice? It appears that embedding new learning in long-term memory requires a process of consolidation, in which memory traces (the brain’s representations of the new learning) are strengthened, given meaning, and connected to prior knowledge—a process that unfolds over hours and may take several days. Rapid-fire practice leans on short-term memory. Durable learning, however, requires time for mental rehearsal and the other processes of consolidation. Hence, spaced practice works better. The increased effort required to retrieve the learning after a little forgetting has the effect of retriggering consolidation, further strengthening memory. We explore some of the theories about this process in the next chapter.

Two groups of college students were taught how to find the volumes of four obscure geometric solids (wedge, spheroid, spherical cone, and half cone). One group then worked a set of practice problems that were clustered by problem type (practice four problems for computing the volume of a wedge, then four problems for a spheroid, etc.). The other group worked the same practice problems, but the sequence was mixed (interleaved) rather than clustered by type of problem. Given what we’ve already presented, the results may not surprise you. During practice, the students who worked the problems in clusters (that is, massed) averaged 89 percent correct, compared to only 60 percent for those who worked the problems in a mixed sequence. But in the final test a week later, the students who had practiced solving problems clustered by type averaged only 20 percent correct, while the students whose practice was interleaved averaged 63 percent. The mixing of problem types, which boosted final test performance by a remarkable 215 percent, actually impeded performance during initial learning.4 Now, suppose you’re a trainer in a company trying to teach employees a complicated new process that involves ten procedures. The typical way of doing this is to train up in procedure 1, repeating it many times until the trainees really seem to have it down cold. Then you go to procedure 2, you do many repetitions of 2, you get that down, and so on. That appears to produce fast learning. What would interleaved practice look like? You practice procedure 1 just a few times, then switch to procedure 4, then switch to 3, then to 7, and so on. (Chapter 8 tells how Farmers Insurance trains new agents in a spiraling series of exercises that cycle back to key skillsets in a seemingly random sequence that adds layers of context and meaning at each turn.) The learning from interleaved practice feels slower than learning from massed practice. Teachers and students sense the difference. They can see that their grasp of each element is coming more slowly, and the compensating long-term advantage is not apparent to them. As a result, interleaving is unpopular and seldom used. Teachers dislike it because it feels sluggish. Students find it confusing: they’re just starting to get a handle on new material and don’t feel on top of it yet when they are forced to switch. But the research shows unequivocally that mastery and long-term retention are much better if you interleave practice than if you mass it.

The beanbag study focused on mastery of motor skills, but much evidence has shown that the underlying principle applies to cognitive learning as well. The basic idea is that varied practice—like tossing your beanbags into baskets at mixed distances—improves your ability to transfer learning from one situation and apply it successfully to another. You develop a broader understanding of the relationships between different conditions and the movements required to succeed in them; you discern context better and develop a more flexible “movement vocabulary”—different movements for different situations. Whether the scope of variable training (e.g., the two- and four-foot tosses) must encompass the particular task (the three-foot toss) is subject for further study. The evidence favoring variable training has been supported by recent neuroimaging studies that suggest that different kinds of practice engage different parts of the brain. The learning of motor skills from varied practice, which is more cognitively challenging than massed practice, appears to be consolidated in an area of the brain associated with the more difficult process of learning higher-order motor skills. The learning of motor skills from massed practice, on the other hand, appears to be consolidated in a different area of the brain that is used for learning more cognitively simple and less challenging motor skills. The inference is that learning gained through the less challenging, massed form of practice is encoded in a simpler or comparatively impoverished representation than the learning gained from the varied and more challenging practice which demands more brain power and encodes the learning in a more flexible representation that can be applied more broadly.5 Among athletes, massed practice has long been the rule: take your hook shot, knock the twenty-foot putt, work your backhand return, throw the pass while rolling out: again and again and again—to get it right and train your “muscle memory.” Or so the notion holds. The benefits of variable training for motor learning have been gaining broader acceptance, albeit slowly. Consider the one-touch pass in hockey. That’s where you receive the puck and immediately pass it to a teammate who’s moving down the ice, keeping the opposition off balance and unable to put pressure on the puck carrier. Jamie Kompon, when he was assistant coach of the Los Angeles Kings, was in the habit of running team practice on one-touch passes from the same position on the rink. Even if this move is interleaved with a sequence of other moves in practice, if you only do it at the same place on the rink or in the same sequence of moves, you are only, as it were, throwing your beanbags into the three-foot bucket. Kompon is onto the difference now and has changed up his drills. Since we talked, he’s gone over to the Chicago Blackhawks. We would have said “Keep an eye on those Blackhawks” here, but as we revise to go into production, Kompon and team have already won the Stanley Cup. Perhaps no coincidence? The benefits of variable practice for cognitive as opposed to motor skills learning were shown in a recent experiment that adapted the beanbag test to verbal learning: in this case, the students solved anagrams–that is, they rearranged letters to form words (tmoce becomes comet). Some subjects practiced the same anagram over and over, whereas others practiced multiple anagrams for the word. When they were all tested on the same anagram that the former group had practiced on, the latter group performed better on it! The same benefits will apply whether you are practicing to identify tree species, differentiate the principles of case law, or master a new computer program.6 ","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:15:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Developing Discrimination Skills Compared to massed practice, a significant advantage of interleaving and variation is that they help us learn better how to assess context and discriminate between problems, selecting and applying the correct solution from a range of possibilities. In math education, massing is embedded in the textbook: each chapter is dedicated to a particular kind of problem, which you study in class and then practice by working, say, twenty examples for homework before you move on. The next chapter has a different type of problem, and you dive into the same kind of concentrated learning and practice of that solution. On you march, chapter by chapter, through the semester. But then, on the final exam, lo and behold, the problems are all mixed up: you’re staring at each one in turn, asking yourself Which algorithm do I use? Was it in chapter 5, 6, or 7? When you have learned under conditions of massed or blocked repetition, you have had no practice on that critical sorting process. But this is the way life usually unfolds: problems and opportunities come at us unpredictably, out of sequence. For our learning to have practical value, we must be adept at discerning “What kind of problem is this?” so we can select and apply an appropriate solution. Several studies have demonstrated the improved powers of discrimination to be gained through interleaved and varied practice. One study involved learning to attribute paintings to the artists who created them, and another focused on learning to identify and classify birds. Researchers initially predicted that massed practice in identifying painters’ works (that is, studying many examples of one painter’s works before moving on to study many examples of another’s works) would best help students learn the defining characteristics of each artist’s style. Massed practice of each artist’s works, one artist at a time, would better enable students to match artworks to artists later, compared to interleaved exposure to the works of different artists. The idea was that interleaving would be too hard and confusing; students would never be able to sort out the relevant dimensions. The researchers were wrong. The commonalities among one painter’s works that the students learned through massed practice proved less useful than the differences between the works of multiple painters that the students learned through interleaving. Interleaving enabled better discrimination and produced better scores on a later test that required matching the works with their painters. The interleaving group was also better able to match painters’ names correctly to new examples of their work that the group had never viewed during the learning phase. Despite these results, the students who participated in these experiments persisted in preferring massed practice, convinced that it served them better. Even after they took the test and could have realized from their own performance that interleaving was the better strategy for learning, they clung to their belief that the concentrated viewing of paintings by one artist was better. The myths of massed practice are hard to exorcise, even when you’re experiencing the evidence yourself.7 The power of interleaving practice to improve discriminability has been reaffirmed in studies of people learning bird classification. The challenge here is more complex than it might seem. One study addressed twenty different bird families (thrashers, swallows, wrens, finches, and so on). Within each family, students were presented with a dozen species (brown thrasher, curve-billed thrasher, Bendire’s thrasher, etc.). To identify a bird’s family, you consider a wide range of traits like size, plumage, behavior, location, beak shape, iris color, and so on. A problem in bird identification is that members of a family share many traits in common but not all. For instance, many but not all thrashers have a long, slightly hooked beak. There are traits that are typical of a family ","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:16:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Improving Complex Mastery for Medical Students The distinction between straightforward knowledge of facts and deeper learning that permits flexible use of the knowledge may be a little fuzzy, but it resonates with Douglas Larsen at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis, who says that the skills required for bird classification are similar to those required of a doctor diagnosing what’s wrong with a patient. “The reason variety is important is it helps us see more nuances in the things that we can compare against,” he says. “That comes up a lot in medicine, in the sense that every patient visit is a test. There are many layers of explicit and implicit memory involved in the ability to discriminate between symptoms and their interrelationships.” Implicit memory is your automatic retrieval of past experience in interpreting a new one. For example, the patient comes in and gives you a story. As you listen, you’re consciously thinking through your mental library to see what fits, while also unconsciously polling your past experiences to help interpret what the patient is telling you. “Then you’re left with making a judgment call,” Larsen says.9 Larsen is a pediatric neurologist seeing patients in the university clinic and hospital. He’s a busy guy: in addition to practicing medicine, he supervises the work of physicians in training, he teaches, and as time permits, he conducts research into medical education, working in collaboration with cognitive psychologists. He’s drawing on all of these roles to redesign and strengthen the school’s training curriculum in pediatric neurology. As you’d expect, the medical school employs a wide spectrum of instructional techniques. Besides classroom lectures and labs, students practice resuscitations and other procedures on high-tech mannequins in three simulation centers the school maintains. Each “patient” is hooked up to monitors, has a heartbeat, blood pressure, pupils that dilate and constrict, and the ability to listen and speak, thanks to a controller who observes and operates the mannequin from a back room. The school also makes use of “standardized patients,” actors who follow scripts and exhibit symptoms the students are required to diagnose. The center is set up like a regular medical clinic, and students must show proficiency in all aspects of a patient encounter, from bedside manner, physical exam skills, and remembering to ask the full spectrum of pertinent questions to arriving at a diagnosis and treatment plan. From studies of these teaching methods, Larsen has drawn some interesting conclusions. First—and this may seem self-evident: you do better on a test to demonstrate your competency at seeing patients in a clinic if your learning experience has involved seeing patients in a clinic. Simply reading about patients is not enough. However, on written final exams, medical students who have examined patients and those who have learned via written tests do equally well. The reason is that in a written test the student is being given considerable structure and being asked for specific information. When examining the patient, you have to come up on your own with the right mental model and the steps to follow. Having practiced these steps on patients or simulated patients improves performance relative to just reading about how to do it. In other words, the kind of retrieval practice that proves most effective is one that reflects what you’ll be doing with the knowledge later. It’s not just what you know, but how you practice what you know that determines how well the learning serves you later. As the sports adage goes, “practice like you play and you will play like you practice.” This conclusion lines up with other research into learning, and with some of the more sophisticated training practices in science and industry, including the increasingly broad use of simulators—not just for jet pilots and medical students but for cops, towboat pilots, and people in almost any field","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:17:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"These Principles Are Broadly Applicable College football might seem an incongruous place to look for a learning model, but a conversation with Coach Vince Dooley about the University of Georgia’s practice regime provides an intriguing case. Dooley is authoritative on the subject. As head coach of Bulldogs football from 1964–1988, he piled up an astonishing 201 wins with only 77 losses and 10 tied games, winning six conference titles and a national championship. He went on to serve as the university’s athletic director, where he built one of the most impressive athletics programs in the country. We asked Coach Dooley how players go about mastering all the complexities of the game. His theories of coaching and training revolve around the weekly cycle of one Saturday game to the next. In that short period there’s a lot to learn: studying the opposition’s type of game in the classroom, discussing offensive and defensive strategies for opposing it, taking the discussion onto the playing field, breaking the strategies down to the movements of individual positions and trying them out, knitting the parts into a whole, and then repeating the moves until they run like clockwork. While all this is going on, the players must also keep their fundamental skills in top form: blocking, tackling, catching the ball, bringing the ball in, carrying the ball. Dooley believes that (1) you have to keep practicing the fundamentals from time to time, forever, so you keep them sharp, otherwise you’re cooked, but (2) you need to change it up in practice because too much repetition is boring. The position coaches work with players individually on specific skills and then on how they’re playing their positions during team practice. What else? There’s practicing the kicking game. There’s the matter of each player’s mastery of the playbook. And there are the special plays from the team’s repertoire that often make the difference between winning and losing. In Dooley’s narrative, the special plays stand as exemplars of spaced learning: they’re practiced only on Thursdays, so there’s always a week between sessions, and the plays are run in a varied sequence. With all this to be done, it’s not surprising that a critical aspect of the team’s success is a very specific daily and weekly schedule that interleaves the elements of individual and team practice. The start of every day’s practice is strictly focused on the fundamentals of each player’s position. Next, players practice in small groups, working on maneuvers involving several positions. These parts are gradually brought together and run as a team. Play is speeded up and slowed down, rehearsed mentally as well as physically. By midweek the team is running the plays in real time, full speed. “You’re coming at it fast, and you’ve got to react fast,” Dooley said. “But as you get closer to game time, you slow it down again. Now it’s a kind of rehearsal without physical contact. The play basically starts out the same each time, but then what the opponent does changes it. So you’ve got to be able to adjust to that. You start into the motion and say, ‘If they react like this, then this is what you would do.’ You practice adjustments. If you do it enough times in different situations, then you’re able to do it pretty well in whatever comes up on the field.”11 How does a player get on top of his playbook? He takes it home and goes over the plays in his mind. He may walk through them. Everything in practice can’t be physically strenuous, Dooley said, or you’d wear yourself out, “so if the play calls for you to step this way and then go the other way, you can rehearse that in your mind, maybe just lean your body as if to go that way. And then if something happens where you have to adjust, you can do that mentally. By reading the playbook, rehearsing it in your mind, maybe taking a step or two to walk through it, you simulate something happening. So that kind of rehearsal is added to what you get in the classroom and ","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:18:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"The Takeaway Here’s a quick rundown of what we know today about massed practice and its alternatives. Scientists will continue to deepen our understanding. We harbor deep convictions that we learn better through single-minded focus and dogged repetition, and these beliefs are validated time and again by the visible improvement that comes during “practice-practice-practice.” But scientists call this heightened performance during the acquisition phase of a skill “momentary strength” and distinguish it from “underlying habit strength.” The very techniques that build habit strength, like spacing, interleaving, and variation, slow visible acquisition and fail to deliver the improvement during practice that helps to motivate and reinforce our efforts.12 Cramming, a form of massed practice, has been likened to binge-and-purge eating. A lot goes in, but most of it comes right back out in short order. The simple act of spacing out study and practice in installments and allowing time to elapse between them makes both the learning and the memory stronger, in effect building habit strength. How big an interval, you ask? The simple answer: enough so that practice doesn’t become a mindless repetition. At a minimum, enough time so that a little forgetting has set in. A little forgetting between practice sessions can be a good thing, if it leads to more effort in practice, but you do not want so much forgetting that retrieval essentially involves relearning the material. The time periods between sessions of practice let memories consolidate. Sleep seems to play a large role in memory consolidation, so practice with at least a day in between sessions is good. Something as simple as a deck of flashcards can provide an example of spacing. Between repetitions of any individual card, you work through many others. The German scientist Sebastian Leitner developed his own system for spaced practice of flashcards, known as the Leitner box. Think of it as a series of four file-card boxes. In the first are the study materials (be they musical scores, hockey moves, or Spanish vocabulary flashcards) that must be practiced frequently because you often make mistakes in them. In the second box are the cards you’re pretty good at, and that box gets practiced less often than the first, perhaps by a half. The cards in the third box are practiced less often than those in the second, and so on. If you miss a question, make mistakes in the music, flub the one-touch pass, you move it up a box so you will practice it more often. The underlying idea is simply that the better your mastery, the less frequent the practice, but if it’s important to retain, it will never disappear completely from your set of practice boxes. Beware of the familiarity trap: the feeling that you know something and no longer need to practice it. This familiarity can hurt you during self-quizzing if you take shortcuts. Doug Larsen says, “You have to be disciplined to say, ‘All right, I’m going to make myself recall all of this and if I don’t, what did I miss, how did I not know that?’ Whereas if you have an instructor-generated test or quiz, suddenly you have to do it, there’s an expectation, you can’t cheat, you can’t take mental shortcuts around it, you simply have to do that.” The nine quizzes Andy Sobel administers over the twenty-six meetings of his political economics course are a simple example of spaced retrieval practice, and of interleaving—because he rolls forward into each successive quiz questions pertaining to work from the beginning of the semester. Interleaving two or more subjects during practice also provides a form of spacing. Interleaving can also help you develop your ability to discriminate later between different kinds of problems and select the right tool from your growing toolkit of solutions. In interleaving, you don’t move from a complete practice set of one topic to go to another. You switch before each practice is complete.

Encoding Let’s imagine you’re Mia, standing in a gravel pit watching a jump instructor explain and demonstrate the parachute landing fall. The brain converts your perceptions into chemical and electrical changes that form a mental representation of the patterns you’ve observed. This process of converting sensory perceptions into meaningful representations in the brain is still not perfectly understood. We call the process encoding, and we call the new representations within the brain memory traces. Think of notes jotted or sketched on a scratchpad, our short-term memory. Much of how we run our day-to-day lives is guided by the ephemera that clutter our short-term memory and are, fortunately, soon forgotten—how to jigger the broken latch on the locker you used when you suited up at the gym today; remembering to stop for an oil change after your workout. But the experiences and learning that we want to salt away for the future must be made stronger and more durable—in Mia’s case, the distinctive moves that will enable her to hit the ground without breaking an ankle, or worse.3 Consolidation The process of strengthening these mental representations for long-term memory is called consolidation. New learning is labile: its meaning is not fully formed and therefore is easily altered. In consolidation, the brain reorganizes and stabilizes the memory traces. This may occur over several hours or longer and involves deep processing of the new material, during which scientists believe that the brain replays or rehearses the learning, giving it meaning, filling in blank spots, and making connections to past experiences and to other knowledge already stored in long-term memory. Prior knowledge is a prerequisite for making sense of new learning, and forming those connections is an important task of consolidation. Mia’s considerable athletic skills, physical self-awareness, and prior experience represent a large body of knowledge to which the elements of a successful PLF would find many connections. As we’ve noted, sleep seems to help memory consolidation, but in any case, consolidation and transition of learning to long-term storage occurs over a period of time. An apt analogy for how the brain consolidates new learning may be the experience of composing an essay. The first draft is rangy, imprecise. You discover what you want to say by trying to write it. After a couple of revisions you have sharpened the piece and cut away some of the extraneous points. You put it aside to let it ferment. When you pick it up again a day or two later, what you want to say has become clearer in your mind. Perhaps you now perceive that there are three main points you are making. You connect them to examples and supporting information familiar to your audience. You rearrange and draw together the elements of your argument to make it more effective and elegant. Similarly, the process of learning something often starts out feeling disorganized and unwieldy; the most important aspects are not always salient. Consolidation helps organize and solidify learning, and, notably, so does retrieval after a lapse of some time, because the act of retrieving a memory from long-term storage can both strengthen the memory traces and at the same time make them modifiable again, enabling them, for example, to connect to more recent learning. This process is called reconsolidation. This is how retrieval practice modifies and strengthens learning. Suppose that on day 2 of jump school, you’re put on the spot to execute your parachute landing fall and you struggle to recall the correct posture and compose yourself—feet and knees together, knees slightly bent, eyes on the horizon—but in the reflex to break your fall you throw your arm out, forgetting to pull your elbows tight to your sides. You could have broken the arm or dislocated your shoulder if this wer","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:20:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Extending Learning: Updating Retrieval Cues There’s virtually no limit to how much learning we can remember as long as we relate it to what we already know. In fact, because new learning depends on prior learning, the more we learn, the more possible connections we create for further learning. Our retrieval capacity, though, is severely limited. Most of what we’ve learned is not accessible to us at any given moment. This limitation on retrieval is helpful to us: if every memory were always readily to hand, you would have a hard time sorting through the sheer volume of material to put your finger on the knowledge you need at the moment: where did I put my hat, how do I sync my electronic devices, what goes into a perfect brandy Manhattan? Knowledge is more durable if it’s deeply entrenched, meaning that you have firmly and thoroughly comprehended a concept, it has practical importance or keen emotional weight in your life, and it is connected with other knowledge that you hold in memory. How readily you can recall knowledge from your internal archives is determined by context, by recent use, and by the number and vividness of cues that you have linked to the knowledge and can call on to help bring it forth.5 Here’s the tricky part. As you go through life, you often need to forget cues associated with older, competing memories so as to associate them successfully with new ones. To learn Italian in middle age, you may have to forget your high school French, because every time you think “to be” and hope to come up with the Italian essere, up pops etre, despite your most earnest intentions. Traveling in England, you have to suppress your cues to drive on the right side of the road so you can establish reliable cues to stay on the left. Knowledge that is well entrenched, like real fluency in French or years of experience driving on the right side of the road, is easily relearned later, after a period of disuse or after being interrupted by competition for retrieval cues. It’s not the knowledge itself that has been forgotten, but the cues that enable you to find and retrieve it. The cues for the new learning, driving on the left, displace those for the old, driving on the right (if we are lucky). The paradox is that some forgetting is often essential for new learning.6 When you change from a PC to a Mac, or from one Windows platform to another, you have to do enormous forgetting in order to learn the architecture of the new system and become adept at manipulating it so readily that your attention can focus on doing your work and not on working the machine. Jump school training provides another example: After their military service, many paratroopers take an interest in smoke jumping. Smokejumpers use different airplanes, different equipment, and different jump protocols. Having trained at the army’s jump school is cited as a distinct disadvantage for smoke jumping, because you have to unlearn one set of procedures that you have practiced to the point of reflex and replace them with another. Even in cases where both bodies of learning seem so similar to the uninitiated—jumping out of an airplane with a parachute on your back—you may have to forget the cues to a complex body of learning that you possess if you are to acquire a new one. We know this problem of reassigning cues to memory from our own lives, even on the simplest levels. When our friend Jack first takes up with Joan, we sometimes call the couple “Jack and Jill,” as the cue “Jack and” pulls up the old nursery rhyme that’s so thoroughly embedded in memory. About the time we have “Jack and” reliably cuing “Joan,” alas, Joan throws him over, and he takes up with Jenny. Good grief! Half of the time that we mean to say Jack and Jenny we catch ourselves saying Jack and Joan. It would have been easier had Jack picked up with Katie, so that the trailing K sound in his name handed us off to the initiating K in hers, but no such luck. Alliteration can be a handy cue, or a subversive ","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:21:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Easier Isn’t Better Psychologists have uncovered a curious inverse relationship between the ease of retrieval practice and the power of that practice to entrench learning: the easier knowledge or a skill is for you to retrieve, the less your retrieval practice will benefit your retention of it. Conversely, the more effort you have to expend to retrieve knowledge or skill, the more the practice of retrieval will entrench it. Not long ago the California Polytechnic State University baseball team, in San Luis Obispo, became involved in an interesting experiment in improving their batting skills. They were all highly experienced players, adept at making solid contact with the ball, but they agreed to take extra batting practice twice a week, following two different practice regimens, to see which type of practice produced better results. Hitting a baseball is one of the hardest skills in sports. It takes less than half a second for a ball to reach home plate. In this instant, the batter must execute a complex combination of perceptual, cognitive, and motor skills: determining the type of pitch, anticipating how the ball will move, and aiming and timing the swing to arrive at the same place and moment as the ball. This chain of perceptions and responses must be so deeply entrenched as to become automatic, because the ball is in the catcher’s mitt long before you can even begin to think your way through how to connect with it. Part of the Cal Poly team practiced in the standard way. They practiced hitting forty-five pitches, evenly divided into three sets. Each set consisted of one type of pitch thrown fifteen times. For example, the first set would be fifteen fastballs, the second set fifteen curveballs, and the third set fifteen changeups. This was a form of massed practice. For each set of 15 pitches, as the batter saw more of that type, he got gratifyingly better at anticipating the balls, timing his swings, and connecting. Learning seemed easy. The rest of the team were given a more difficult practice regimen: the three types of pitches were randomly interspersed across the block of forty-five throws. For each pitch, the batter had no idea which type to expect. At the end of the forty-five swings, he was still struggling somewhat to connect with the ball. These players didn’t seem to be developing the proficiency their teammates were showing. The interleaving and spacing of different pitches made learning more arduous and feel slower. The extra practice sessions continued twice weekly for six weeks. At the end, when the players’ hitting was assessed, the two groups had clearly benefited differently from the extra practice, and not in the way the players expected. Those who had practiced on the randomly interspersed pitches now displayed markedly better hitting relative to those who had practiced on one type of pitch thrown over and over. These results are all the more interesting when you consider that these players were already skilled hitters prior to the extra training. Bringing their performance to an even higher level is good evidence of a training regimen’s effectiveness. Here again we see the two familiar lessons. First, that some difficulties that require more effort and slow down apparent gains—like spacing, interleaving, and mixing up practice—will feel less productive at the time but will more than compensate for that by making the learning stronger, precise, and enduring. Second, that our judgments of what learning strategies work best for us are often mistaken, colored by illusions of mastery. When the baseball players at Cal Poly practiced curveball after curveball over fifteen pitches, it became easier for them to remember the perceptions and responses they needed for that type of pitch: the look of the ball’s spin, how the ball changed direction, how fast its direction changed, and how long to wait for it to curve. Performance improved, but the growing ease of recalling these perceptions and responses led to lit","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:22:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"How Effort Helps Reconsolidating Memory Effortful recall of learning, as happens in spaced practice, requires that you “reload” or reconstruct the components of the skill or material anew from long-term memory rather than mindlessly repeating them from short-term memory.10 During this focused, effortful recall, the learning is made pliable again: the most salient aspects of it become clearer, and the consequent reconsolidation helps to reinforce meaning, strengthen connections to prior knowledge, bolster the cues and retrieval routes for recalling it later, and weaken competing routes. Spaced practice, which allows some forgetting to occur between sessions, strengthens both the learning and the cues and routes for fast retrieval when that learning is needed again, as when the pitcher tries to surprise the batter with a curveball after pitching several fastballs. The more effort that is required to recall a memory or to execute a skill, provided that the effort succeeds, the more the act of recalling or executing benefits the learning.11 Massed practice gives us the warm sensation of mastery because we’re looping information through short-term memory without having to reconstruct the learning from long-term memory. But just as with rereading as a study strategy, the fluency gained through massed practice is transitory, and our sense of mastery is illusory. It’s the effortful process of reconstructing the knowledge that triggers reconsolidation and deeper learning. Creating Mental Models With enough effortful practice, a complex set of interrelated ideas or a sequence of motor skills fuse into a meaningful whole, forming a mental model somewhat akin to a “brain app”. Learning to drive a car involves a host of simultaneous actions that require all of our powers of concentration and dexterity while we are learning them. But over time, these combinations of cognition and motor skills—for example, the perceptions and maneuvers required to parallel park or manipulate a stick shift—become ingrained as sets of mental models associated with driving. Mental models are forms of deeply entrenched and highly efficient skills (seeing and unloading on a curveball) or knowledge structures (a memorized sequence of chess moves) that, like habits, can be adapted and applied in varied circumstances. Expert performance is built through thousands of hours of practice in your area of expertise, in varying conditions, through which you accumulate a vast library of such mental models that enables you to correctly discern a given situation and instantaneously select and execute the correct response. Broadening Mastery Retrieval practice that you perform at different times and in different contexts and that interleaves different learning material has the benefit of linking new associations to the material. This process builds interconnected networks of knowledge that bolster and support mastery of your field. It also multiplies the cues for retrieving the knowledge, increasing the versatility with which you can later apply it. Think of an experienced chef who has internalized the complex knowledge of how flavors and textures interact; how ingredients change form under heat; the differing effects to be achieved with a saucepan versus a wok, with copper versus cast iron. Think of the fly fisher who can sense the presence of trout and accurately judge the likely species, make the right choice of dry fly, nymph, or streamer, judge the wind, and know how and where to drop that fly to make the trout rise. Think of the kid on the BMX bike who can perform bunnyhops, tail whips, 180s, and wall taps off the features of an unfamiliar streetscape. Interleaving and variation mix up the contexts of practice and the other skills and knowledge with which the new material is associated. This makes our mental models more versatile, enabling us to apply our learning to a broader range of situations.

Would you rather read an article that has normal type or type that’s somewhat out of focus? Almost surely you would opt for the former. Yet when text on a page is slightly out of focus or presented in a font that is a little difficult to decipher, people recall the content better. Should the outline of a lecture follow the precise flow of a chapter in a textbook, or is it better if the lecture mismatches the text in some ways? It turns out that when the outline of a lecture proceeds in a different order from the textbook passage, the effort to discern the main ideas and reconcile the discrepancy produces better recall of the content. In another surprise, when letters are omitted from words in a text, requiring the reader to supply them, reading is slowed, and retention improves. In all of these examples, the change from normal presentation introduces a difficulty—disruption of fluency—that makes the learner work harder to construct an interpretation that makes sense. The added effort increases comprehension and learning. (Of course, learning will not improve if the difficulty completely obscures the meaning or cannot be overcome.)13 The act of trying to answer a question or attempting to solve a problem rather than being presented with the information or the solution is known as generation. Even if you’re being quizzed on material you’re familiar with, the simple act of filling in a blank has the effect of strengthening your memory of the material and your ability to recall it later. In testing, being required to supply an answer rather than select from multiple choice options often provides stronger learning benefits. Having to write a short essay makes them stronger still. Overcoming these mild difficulties is a form of active learning, where students engage in higher-order thinking tasks rather than passively receiving knowledge conferred by others. When you’re asked to supply an answer or a solution to something that’s new to you, the power of generation to aid learning is even more evident. One explanation for this effect is the idea that as you cast about for a solution, retrieving related knowledge from memory, you strengthen the route to a gap in your learning even before the answer is provided to fill it and, when you do fill it, connections are made to the related material that is fresh in your mind from the effort. For example, if you’re from Vermont and are asked to name the capital of Texas you might start ruminating on possibilities: Dallas? San Antonio? El Paso? Houston? Even if you’re unsure, thinking about alternatives before you hit on (or are given) the correct answer will help you. (Austin, of course.) Wrestling with the question, you rack your brain for something that might give you an idea. You may get curious, even stumped or frustrated and acutely aware of the hole in your knowledge that needs filling. When you’re then shown the solution, a light goes on. Unsuccessful attempts to solve a problem encourage deep processing of the answer when it is later supplied, creating fertile ground for its encoding, in a way that simply reading the answer cannot. It’s better to solve a problem than to memorize a solution. It’s better to attempt a solution and supply the incorrect answer than not to make the attempt.14 The act of taking a few minutes to review what has been learned from an experience (or in a recent class) and asking yourself questions is known as reflection. After a lecture or reading assignment, for example, you might ask yourself: What are the key ideas? What are some examples? How do these relate to what I already know? Following an experience where you are practicing new knowledge or skills, you might ask: What went well? What could have gone better?

F. Skinner advocated the adoption of “errorless learning” methods in education in the belief that errors by learners are counterproductive and result from faulty instruction. The theory of errorless learning gave rise to instructional techniques in which learners were spoonfed new material in small bites and immediately quizzed on them while they still remained on the tongue, so to speak, fresh in short-term memory and easily spit out onto the test form. There was virtually no chance of making an error. Since those days we’ve come to understand that retrieval from short-term memory is an ineffective learning strategy and that errors are an integral part of striving to increase one’s mastery over new material. Yet in our Western culture, where achievement is seen as an indicator of ability, many learners view errors as failure and do what they can to avoid committing them. The aversion to failure may be reinforced by instructors who labor under the belief that when learners are allowed to make errors it’s the errors that they will learn.16 This is a misguided impulse. When learners commit errors and are given corrective feedback, the errors are not learned. Even strategies that are highly likely to result in errors, like asking someone to try to solve a problem before being shown how to do it, produce stronger learning and retention of the correct information than more passive learning strategies, provided there is corrective feedback. Moreover, people who are taught that learning is a struggle that often involves making errors will go on to exhibit a greater propensity to tackle tough challenges and will tend to see mistakes not as failures but as lessons and turning points along the path to mastery. To see the truth of this, look no further than the kid down the hall who is deeply absorbed in working his avatar up through the levels of an action game on his Xbox video console. A fear of failure can poison learning by creating aversions to the kinds of experimentation and risk taking that characterize striving, or by diminishing performance under pressure, as in a test setting. In the latter instance, students who have a high fear of making errors when taking tests may actually do worse on the test because of their anxiety. Why? It seems that a significant portion of their working memory capacity is expended to monitor their performance (How am I doing? Am I making mistakes?), leaving less working memory capacity available to solve the problems posed by the test. “Working memory” refers to the amount of information you can hold in mind while working through a problem, especially in the face of distraction. Everyone’s working memory is severely limited, some more than others, and larger working memory capacities correlate with higher IQs. To explore this theory about how fear of failure reduces test performance, sixth graders in France were given very difficult anagram problems that none of them could solve. After struggling unsuccessfully with the problems, half of the kids received a ten-minute lesson in which they were taught that difficulty is a crucial part of learning, errors are natural and to be expected, and practice helps, just as in learning to ride a bicycle. The other kids were simply asked how they had gone about trying to solve the anagrams. Then both groups were given a difficult test whose results provided a measure of working memory. The kids who had been taught that errors are a natural part of learning showed significantly better use of working memory than did the others. These children did not expend their working memory capacity in agonizing over the difficulty of the task. The theory was further tested in variations of the original study. The results support the finding that difficulty can create feelings of incompetence that engender anxiety, which in turn disrupts learning, and that “students do better when given room","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:25:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"An Example of Generative Learning As we said earlier, the process of trying to solve a problem without the benefit of having been taught how is called generative learning, meaning that the learner is generating the answer rather than recalling it. Generation is another name for old-fashioned trial and error. We’re all familiar with the stories of skinny kids in Silicon Valley garages messing around with computers and coming out billionaires. We would like to serve up a different kind of example here: Minnesota’s Bonnie Blodgett. Bonnie is a writer and a self-taught ornamental gardener in a constant argument with a voice in her head that keeps nattering about all the ways her latest whim is sure to go haywire and embarrass her. While she is a woman of strong aesthetic sensibilities, she is also one of epic doubts. Her “learning style” might be called leap-before-you-look-because-if-you-look-first-you-probably-won’t-like-what-you-see. Her garden writing appears under the name “The Blundering Gardener.” This moniker is a way of telling her voices of doubt to take a hike, because whatever the consequences of the next whim, she’s already rolling up her sleeves. “Blundering means that you get going on your project before you have figured out how to do it in the proper way, before you know what you’re getting into. For me, the risk of knowing what you’re getting into is that it becomes an overwhelming obstacle to getting started.”18 Bonnie’s success shows how struggling with a problem makes for strong learning, and how a sustained commitment to advancing in a particular field of endeavor through trial-and-error effort leads to complex mastery and greater knowledge of the interrelationships of things. When we spoke, she had just traveled to southern Minnesota to meet with a group of farmers who wanted her gardening insights on a gamut of issues ranging from layout and design to pest control and irrigation. In the years since she first sank her spade, Bonnie’s garden writing has won national recognition and found a devoted following far and wide through many outlets, and her garden has become a destination for other gardeners. She came to ornamental gardening about the time she found herself eyeballing middle age. She had no training, just a burning desire to get her hands dirty making beautiful spaces on the corner lot of the home she shares with her husband in a historic neighborhood of St. Paul. “The experience of creating beauty calms me down,” she says, but it’s strictly a discovery process. She has always been a writer, and some years after having launched herself into the garden, she began publishing the Garden Letter, a quarterly for northern gardeners in which she chronicles her exploits, mishaps, lessons, and successes. She writes the same way that she gardens, with boldness and self-effacing humor, passing along the entertaining snafus and unexpected insights that are the fruits of experience. In calling herself the Blundering Gardener, she is giving herself and us, her readers, permission to make mistakes and get on with it. Note that in writing about her experiences, Bonnie is engaging two potent learning processes beyond the act of gardening itself. She is retrieving the details and the story of what she has discovered—say, about an experiment in grafting two species of fruit trees—and then she is elaborating by explaining the experience to her readers, connecting the outcome to what she already knows about the subject or has learned as a result. Her leap-taking impulses have taken her through vast swaths of the plant kingdom, of course, and deeply into the Latin nomenclature and the classic horticultural literature. These impulses have also drawn her into the aesthetics of space and structure and the mechanics thereof: building stone walls; digging and wiring water features; putting a cupola on the garage; building paths, stairs, and gates; ripping out a Gothic picket fence and reusing the wood to create something more o","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:26:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Undesirable Difficulties Elizabeth and Robert Bjork, who coined the phrase “desirable difficulties,” write that difficulties are desirable because “they trigger encoding and retrieval processes that support learning, comprehension, and remembering. If, however, the learner does not have the background knowledge or skills to respond to them successfully, they become undesirable difficulties.”19 Cognitive scientists know from empirical studies that testing, spacing, interleaving, variation, generation, and certain kinds of contextual interference lead to stronger learning and retention. Beyond that, we have an intuitive sense of what kinds of difficulties are undesirable but, for lack of the needed research, we cannot yet be definitive. Clearly, impediments that you cannot overcome are not desirable. Outlining a lesson in a sequence different from the one in the textbook is not a desirable difficulty for learners who lack the reading skills or language fluency required to hold a train of thought long enough to reconcile the discrepancy. If your textbook is written in Lithuanian and you don’t know the language, this hardly represents a desirable difficulty. To be desirable, a difficulty must be something learners can overcome through increased effort. Intuitively it makes sense that difficulties that don’t strengthen the skills you will need, or the kinds of challenges you are likely to encounter in the real-world application of your learning, are not desirable. Having somebody whisper in your ear while you read the news may be essential training for a TV anchor. Being heckled by role-playing protestors while honing your campaign speech may help train up a politician. But neither of these difficulties is likely to be helpful for Rotary Club presidents or aspiring YouTube bloggers who want to improve their stage presence. A cub towboat pilot on the Mississippi might be required in training to push a string of high-riding empty barges into a lock against a strong side wind. A baseball player might practice hitting with a weight on his bat to strengthen his swing. You might teach a football player some of the principles of ballet for learning balance and movement, but you probably would not teach him the techniques for an effective golf drive or backhand tennis serve. Is there an overarching rule that determines the kinds of impediments that make learning stronger? Time and further research may yield an answer. But the kinds of difficulties we’ve just described, whose desirability is well documented, offer a large and diverse toolkit already at hand.

Consolidation reorganizes and stabilizes memory traces, gives them meaning, and makes connections to past experiences and to other knowledge already stored in long-term memory. Retrieval updates learning and enables you to apply it when you need it. Learning always builds on a store of prior knowledge. We interpret and remember events by building connections to what we already know. Long-term memory capacity is virtually limitless: the more you know, the more possible connections you have for adding new knowledge. Because of the vast capacity of long-term memory, having the ability to locate and recall what you know when you need it is key; your facility for calling up what you know depends on the repeated use of the information (to keep retrieval routes strong) and on your establishing powerful retrieval cues that can reactivate the memories. Periodic retrieval of learning helps strengthen connections to the memory and the cues for recalling it, while also weakening routes to competing memories. Retrieval practice that’s easy does little to strengthen learning; the more difficult the practice, the greater the benefit. When you recall learning from short-term memory, as in rapid-fire practice, little mental effort is required, and little long-term benefit accrues. But when you recall it after some time has elapsed and your grasp of it has become a little rusty, you have to make an effort to reconstruct it. This effortful retrieval both strengthens the memory but also makes the learning pliable again, leading to its reconsolidation. Reconsolidation helps update your memories with new information and connect them to more recent learning. Repeated effortful recall or practice helps integrate learning into mental models, in which a set of interrelated ideas or a sequence of motor skills are fused into a meaningful whole that can be adapted and applied in later settings. Examples are the perceptions and manipulations involved in driving a car or in knocking a curveball out of the ballpark. When practice conditions are varied or retrieval is interleaved with the practice of other material, we increase our abilities of discrimination and induction and the versatility with which we can apply the learning in new settings at a later date. Interleaving and variation build new connections, expanding and more firmly entrenching knowledge in memory and increasing the number of cues for retrieval. Trying to come up with an answer rather than having it presented to you, or trying to solve a problem before being shown the solution, leads to better learning and longer retention of the correct answer or solution, even when your attempted response is wrong, so long as corrective feedback is provided. 5 Avoid Illusions of Knowing AT THE ROOT of our effectiveness is our ability to grasp the world around us and to take the measure of our own performance. We’re constantly making judgments about what we know and don’t know and whether we’re capable of handling a task or solving a problem. As we work at something, we keep an eye on ourselves, adjusting our thinking or actions as we progress. Monitoring your own thinking is what psychologists call metacognition (meta is Greek for “about”). Learning to be accurate self-observers helps us to stay out of blind alleys, make good decisions, and reflect on how we might do better next time. An important part of this skill is being sensitive to the ways we can delude ourselves. One problem with poor judgment is that we usually don’t know when we’ve got it. Another problem is the sheer scope of the ways our judgment can be led astray.1 In this chapter we discuss perceptual illusions, cognitive biases, and distortions of memory that commonly mislead people.

What he calls System 1 (or the automatic system) is unconscious, intuitive, and immediate. It draws on our senses and memories to size up a situation in the blink of an eye. It’s the running back dodging tackles in his dash for the end zone. It’s the Minneapolis cop, walking up to a driver he’s pulled over on a chilly day, taking evasive action even before he’s fully aware that his eye has seen a bead of sweat run down the driver’s temple. System 2 (the controlled system) is our slower process of conscious analysis and reasoning. It’s the part of thinking that considers choices, makes decisions, and exerts self-control. We also use it to train System 1 to recognize and respond to particular situations that demand reflexive action. The running back is using System 2 when he walks through the moves in his playbook. The cop is using it when he practices taking a gun from a shooter. The neurosurgeon is using it when he rehearses his repair of the torn sinus. System 1 is automatic and deeply influential, but it is susceptible to illusion, and you depend on System 2 to help you manage yourself: by checking your impulses, planning ahead, identifying choices, thinking through their implications, and staying in charge of your actions. When a guy in a restaurant walks past a mother with an infant and the infant cries out “Dada!” that’s System 1. When the blushing mother says, “No, dear, that’s not Dada, that’s a man,” she is acting as a surrogate System 2, helping the infant refine her System 1. System 1 is powerful because it draws on our accumulated years of experience and our deep emotions. System 1 gives us the survival reflex in moments of danger, and the astonishing deftness earned through thousands of hours of deliberate practice in a chosen field of expertise. In the interplay between Systems 1 and 2—the topic of Malcolm Gladwell’s book *Blink—*your instantaneous ability to size up a situation plays against your capacity for skepticism and thoughtful analysis. Of course, when System 1’s conclusions arise out of misperception or illusion, they can steer you into trouble. Learning when to trust your intuition and when to question it is a big part of how you improve your competence in the world at large and in any field where you want to be expert. It’s not just the dullards who fall victim. We all do, to varying degrees. Pilots, for example, are susceptible to a host of perceptual illusions. They are trained to beware of them and to use their instruments to know that they’re getting things right. A frightening example with a happy ending is China Airlines Flight 006 on a winter day in 1985. The Boeing 747 was 41,000 feet above the Pacific, almost ten hours into its eleven-hour flight from Taipei to LA, when engine number 4 lost power. The plane began to lose airspeed. Rather than taking manual control and descending below 30,000 feet to restart the engine, as prescribed in the flight book, the crew held at 41,000 with the autopilot engaged and attempted a restart. Meanwhile, loss of the outboard engine gave the plane asymmetrical thrust. The autopilot tried to correct for this and keep the plane level, but as the plane continued to slow it also began to roll to the right. The captain was aware of the deceleration, but not the extent to which the plane had entered a right bank; his System 1 clue would have been his vestibular reflex—how the inner ear senses balance and spatial orientation—but because of the plane’s trajectory, he had the sensation of flying level. His System 2 clues would have been a glimpse at the horizon and his instruments. Correct procedure called for applying left rudder to help raise the right wing, but his System 2 focus was on the airspeed indicator and on the efforts of the first officer and engineer to restart the engine.

There are many ways that our System 1 and System 2 judgments can be led astray: perceptual illusions like those experienced by pilots, faulty narrative, distortions of memory, failure to recognize when a new kind of problem requires a new kind of solution, and a variety of cognitive biases to which we’re prone. We describe a number of these hazards here, and then we offer measures you can take, akin to scanning the cockpit instruments, to help keep your thinking aligned with reality. Our understanding of the world is shaped by a hunger for narrative that rises out of our discomfort with ambiguity and arbitrary events. When surprising things happen, we search for an explanation. The urge to resolve ambiguity can be surprisingly potent, even when the subject is inconsequential. In a study where participants thought they were being measured for reading comprehension and their ability to solve anagrams, they were exposed to the distraction of a background phone conversation. Some heard only one side of a conversation, and others heard both sides. The participants, not knowing that the distraction itself was the subject of the study, tried to ignore what they were hearing so as to stay focused on the reading and anagram solutions. The results showed that overhearing one side of a conversation proved more distracting than overhearing both sides, and the content of those partial conversations was better recalled later by the unintentional eavesdroppers. Why was this? Presumably, those overhearing half a conversation were strongly compelled to try to infer the missing half in a way that made for a complete narrative. As the authors point out, the study may help explain why we find one-sided cell phone conversations in public spaces so intrusive, but it also reveals the ineluctable way we are drawn to imbue the events around us with rational explanations. The discomfort with ambiguity and arbitrariness is equally powerful, or more so, in our need for a rational understanding of our own lives. We strive to fit the events of our lives into a cohesive story that accounts for our circumstances, the things that befall us, and the choices we make. Each of us has a different narrative that has many threads woven into it from our shared culture and experience of being human, as well as many distinct threads that explain the singular events of one’s personal past. All these experiences influence what comes to mind in a current situation and the narrative through which you make sense of it: Why nobody in my family attended college until me. Why my father never made a fortune in business. Why I’d never want to work in a corporation, or, maybe, Why I would never want to work for myself. We gravitate to the narratives that best explain our emotions. In this way, narrative and memory become one. The memories we organize meaningfully become those that are better remembered. Narrative provides not only meaning but also a mental framework for imbuing future experiences and information with meaning, in effect shaping new memories to fit our established constructs of the world and ourselves. No reader, when asked to account for the choices made under pressure by a novel’s protagonist, can keep her own life experience from shading her explanation of what must have been going on in the character’s interior world.

To use an analogy from a previous chapter, you could think of them as something like smart-phone apps in the brain. We call them mental models. Two examples in police work are the choreography of the routine traffic stop and the moves to take a weapon from an assailant at close quarters. Each of these maneuvers involves a set of perceptions and actions that cops can adapt with little conscious thought in response to context and situation. For a barista, a mental model would be the steps and ingredients to produce a perfect sixteen-ounce decaf frappuccino. For the receptionist at urgent care, it’s triage and registration. The better you know something, the more difficult it becomes to teach it. So says physicist and educator Eric Mazur of Harvard. Why? As you get more expert in complex areas, your models in those areas grow more complex, and the component steps that compose them fade into the background of memory (the curse of knowledge). A physicist, for example, will create a mental library of the principles of physics she can use to solve the various kinds of problems she encounters in her work: Newton’s laws of motion, for example, or the laws of conservation of momentum. She will tend to sort problems based on their underlying principles, whereas a novice will group them by similarity of surface features, like the apparatus being manipulated in the problem (pulley, inclined plane, etc.). One day, when she goes to teach an intro physics class, she explains how a particular problem calls for something from Newtonian mechanics, forgetting that her students have yet to master the underlying steps she has long ago bundled into one unified mental model. This presumption by the professor that her students will readily follow something complex that appears fundamental in her own mind is a metacognitive error, a misjudgment of the matchup between what she knows and what her students know. Mazur says that the person who knows best what a student is struggling with in assimilating new concepts is not the professor, it’s another student.15 This problem is illustrated through a very simple experiment in which one person plays a common tune inside her head and taps the rhythm with her knuckles and another person hearing the rhythmic taps must guess the tune. Each tune comes from a fixed set of twenty-five, so the statistical chance of guessing it is 4 percent. Tellingly, the participants who have the tune in mind estimate that the other person will guess correctly 50 percent of the time, but in fact the listeners guess correctly only 2.5 percent of the time, no better than chance.16 Like Coach Dooley’s football players memorizing their playbooks, we all build mental libraries of myriad useful solutions that we can call on at will to help us work our way from one Saturday game to the next. But we can be tripped by these models, too, when we fail to recognize a new problem that appears to be a familiar one is actually something quite different and we pull out a solution to address it that doesn’t work or makes things worse. The failure to recognize when your solution doesn’t fit the problem is another form of faulty self-observation that can lead you into trouble. Mike Ebersold, the neurosurgeon, was called into the operating room one day to help a surgical resident who, in the midst of removing a brain tumor, was losing the patient. The usual model for cutting out a tumor calls for taking your time, working carefully around the growth, getting a clean margin, saving the surrounding nerves. But when the growth is in the brain, and if you get bleeding behind it, pressure on the brain can turn fatal. Instead of slow-and-careful, you need just the opposite, cutting the growth out very quickly so the blood can drain, and then working to repair the bleeding. “Initially y","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:31:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Unskilled and Unaware of It Incompetent people lack the skills to improve because they are unable to distinguish between incompetence and competence. This phenomenon, of particular interest for metacognition, has been named the Dunning-Kruger effect after the psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger. Their research showed that incompetent people overestimate their own competence and, failing to sense a mismatch between their performance and what is desirable, see no need to try to improve. (The title of their initial paper on the topic was “Unskilled and Unaware of It.”) Dunning and Kruger have also shown that incompetent people can be taught to raise their competence by learning the skills to judge their own performance more accurately, in short, to make their metacognition more accurate. In one series of studies that demonstrate this finding, they gave students a test of logic and asked them to rate their own performance. In the first experiment the results confirmed expectations that the least competent students were the most out of touch with their performance: students who scored at the twelfth percentile on average believed that their general logical reasoning ability fell at the sixty-eighth percentile. In a second experiment, after taking an initial test and rating their own performance, the students were shown the other students’ answers and then their own answers and asked to reestimate the number of test questions they had answered correctly. The students whose performance was in the bottom quartile failed to judge their own performance more accurately after seeing the more competent choices of their peers and in fact tended to raise their already inflated estimates of their own ability. A third experiment explored whether poor performers could learn to improve their judgment. The students were given ten problems in logical reasoning and after the test were asked to rate their logical reasoning skills and test performance. Once again, the students in the bottom quartile grossly overestimated their performance. Next, half the students received ten minutes of training in logic (how to test the accuracy of a syllogism); the other half of the students were given an unrelated task. All the students were then asked to estimate again how well they had performed on the test. Now the students in the bottom quartile who had received the training were much more accurate estimators of the number of questions they got right and of how they performed compared to the other students. Those in the bottom quartile who didn’t receive the training held to their mistaken conviction that they had performed well. How is it that incompetent people fail to learn through experience that they are unskilled? Dunning and Kruger offer several theories. One is that people seldom receive negative feedback about their skills and abilities from others in everyday life, because people don’t like to deliver the bad news. Even if people get negative feedback, they must come to an accurate understanding of why the failure occurred. For success everything must go right, but by contrast, failure can be attributed to any number of external causes: it’s easy to blame the tool for what the hand cannot do. Finally, Dunning and Kruger suggest that some people are just not astute at reading how other people are performing and are therefore less able to spot competence when they see it, making them less able to make comparative judgments of their own performance. These effects are more likely to occur in some contexts and with some skills than with others. In some domains, the revelation of one’s incompetence can be brutally frank. The authors can all remember from their childhoods when a teacher would appoint two boys to pick other kids for softball teams. The good players are picked first, the worst last.

Doing cumulative quizzing, as Andy Sobel does in his political economics course, is especially powerful for consolidating learning and knitting the concepts from one stage of a course into new material encountered later. As a learner, you can use any number of practice techniques to self-test your mastery, from answering flashcards to explaining key concepts in your own words, and to peer instruction (see below). Don’t make the mistake of dropping material from your testing regime once you’ve gotten it correct a couple of times. If it’s important, it needs to be practiced, and practiced again. And don’t put stock in momentary gains that result from massed practice. Space your testing, vary your practice, keep the long view. Peer instruction, a learning model developed by Eric Mazur, incorporates many of the foregoing principles. The material to be covered in class is assigned for reading beforehand. In class, the lecture is interspersed with quick tests that present students with a conceptual question and give them a minute or two to grapple with it; they then try, in small groups, to reach a consensus on the correct answer. In Mazur’s experience, this process engages the students in the underlying concepts of the lecture material; reveals students’ problems in reaching understanding; and provides opportunities for them to explain their understanding, receive feedback, and assess their learning compared to other students. Likewise, the process serves as a gauge for the instructor of how well the students are assimilating the material and in what areas more or less work is needed. Mazur tries to pair students who initially had different answers to a question so that they can see another point of view and try to convince one another of who is right. For two more examples of this technique, see the profiles of the professors Mary Pat Wenderoth and Michael D. Matthews in Chapter 8 .20 Pay attention to the cues you’re using to judge what you have learned. Whether something feels familiar or fluent is not always a reliable indicator of learning. Neither is your level of ease in retrieving a fact or a phrase on a quiz shortly after encountering it in a lecture or text. (Ease of retrieval after a delay, however, is a good indicator of learning.) Far better is to create a mental model of the material that integrates the various ideas across a text, connects them to what you already know, and enables you to draw inferences. How ably you can explain a text is an excellent cue for judging comprehension, because you must recall the salient points from memory, put them into your own words, and explain why they are significant—how they relate to the larger subject. Instructors should give corrective feedback, and learners should seek it. In his interview with Errol Morris, the psychologist David Dunning argues that the path to self-insight leads through other people. “So it really depends on what sort of feedback you are getting. Is the world telling you good things? Is the world rewarding you in a way that you would expect a competent person to be rewarded? If you watch other people, you often find there are different ways to do things; there are better ways to do things. ‘I’m not as good as I thought I was, but I have something to work on.’ ” Think of the kids lining up to join the softball team—would you be picked?21 In many fields, the practice of peer review serves as an external gauge, providing feedback on one’s performance.

When he was two his mother, Doris, told him he couldn’t cross the street because a car might hit him. Every day, Bruce crossed the street, and every day Doris gave him a spanking. “He was born aggressive,” Doris told friends. At eight he bought a ball of string at a garage sale for a dime, cut it up, and sold the pieces for a nickel each. At ten he got a paper route. At eleven he added caddying. At twelve he stuffed his pocket with $30 in savings, sneaked out of his bedroom window before dawn with an empty suitcase, and hitchhiked 255 miles to Aberdeen, South Dakota. He stocked up on Black Cats, cherry bombs, and roman candles, illegal in Minnesota, and hitched home before supper. Over the next week, Doris couldn’t figure out why all the paperboys were dropping by the house for a few minutes and leaving. Bruce had struck gold, but the paper route supervisor found out and tipped off Bruce Senior. The father told the son if he ever did it again he’d get the licking of his life. Bruce repeated the buying trip the following summer and got the promised licking. “It was worth it,” he says.2 He was thirteen, and he had learned a lesson about high demand and short supply. The way Bruce figured, rich people were probably no smarter than he was, they just had knowledge he lacked. Looking at how he went after the knowledge he sought will illustrate some of the learning differences that matter. One, of course, is taking charge of your own education, a habit with Bruce from age two that he has exhibited through the years with remarkable persistence. There are other signal behaviors. As he throws himself into one scheme after another, he draws lessons that improve his focus and judgment. He knits what he learns into mental models of investing, which he then uses to size up more complex opportunities and find his way through the weeds, plucking the telling details from masses of irrelevant information to reach the payoff at the end. These behaviors are what psychologists call “rule learning” and “structure building.” People who as a matter of habit extract underlying principles or rules from new experiences are more successful learners than those who take their experiences at face value, failing to infer lessons that can be applied later in similar situations. Likewise, people who single out salient concepts from the less important information they encounter in new material and who link these key ideas into a mental structure are more successful learners than those who cannot separate wheat from chaff and understand how the wheat is made into flour. When he was barely a teenager, Bruce saw a flyer advertising wooded lots on a lake in central Minnesota. Advised that no one ever lost money on real estate, he bought one. Over four subsequent summers, with occasional help from his dad, he built a house on it, confronting each step in the process one at a time, figuring it out for himself or finding someone to show him how. To dig the basement, he borrowed a trailer and hooked it up to his ’49 Hudson. He paid 50 cents for every load his friends excavated, shovel by shovel, and then charged the owner of a nearby lot that needed fill a dollar for it. He learned how to lay block from a friend whose father was in the cement business and then laid himself a foundation. He learned how to frame the walls from the salesman at the lumber yard. He plumbed the house and wired it the same way, a wide-eyed kid asking around how you do that sort of thing. “The electrical inspector disapproved it,” Bruce recalls. “At the time, I figured it was because they wanted a union guy to do it, so I popped for a union guy to come up from the Cities and redo all my wiring. Looking back, I’m sure what I had done was totally dangerous.” He was nineteen and a university student the summer he traded the house for the down payment on a fourplex ","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:34:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Successful Intelligence Intelligence is a learning difference that we do know matters, but what exactly is it? Every human society has a concept that corresponds to the idea of intelligence in our culture. The problem of how to define and measure intelligence in a way that accounts for people’s intellectual horsepower and provides a fair indicator of their potential has been with us for over a hundred years, with psychologists trying to measure this construct since early in the twentieth century. Psychologists today generally accept that individuals possess at least two kinds of intelligence. Fluid intelligence is the ability to reason, see relationships, think abstractly, and hold information in mind while working on a problem; crystallized intelligence is one’s accumulated knowledge of the world and the procedures or mental models one has developed from past learning and experience. Together, these two kinds of intelligence enable us to learn, reason, and solve problems.7 Traditionally, IQ tests have been used to measure individuals’ logical and verbal potential. These tests assign an Intelligence Quotient, which denotes the ratio of mental age to physical age, times 100. That is, an eight-year-old who can solve problems on a test that most ten-year-olds can solve has an IQ of 125 (10 divided by 8, times 100). It used to be thought that IQ was fixed from birth, but traditional notions of intellectual capacity are being challenged. One countervailing idea, put forward by the psychologist Howard Gardner to account for the broad variety in people’s abilities, is the hypothesis that humans have as many as eight different kinds of intelligence: Logical-mathematical intelligence: ability to think critically, work with numbers and abstractions, and the like; Spatial intelligence: three-dimensional judgment and the ability to visualize with the mind’s eye; Linguistic intelligence: ability to work with words and languages; Kinesthetic intelligence: physical dexterity and control of one’s body; Musical intelligence: sensitivity to sounds, rhythms, tones, and music; Interpersonal intelligence: ability to “read” other people and work with them effectively; Intrapersonal intelligence: ability to understand one’s self and make accurate judgments of one’s knowledge, abilities, and effectiveness; Naturalistic intelligence: the ability to discriminate and relate to one’s natural surroundings (for example, the kinds of intelligence invoked by a gardener, hunter, or chef). Gardner’s ideas are attractive for many reasons, not the least because they attempt to explain human differences that we can observe but cannot account for with modern, Western definitions of intelligence with their focus on language and logic abilities. As with learning styles theory, the multiple intelligences model has helped educators to diversify the kinds of learning experiences they offer. Unlike learning styles, which can have the perverse effect of causing individuals to perceive their learning abilities as limited, multiple intelligences theory elevates the sheer variety of tools in our native toolkit. What both theories lack is an underpinning of empirical validation, a problem Gardner himself recognizes, acknowledging that determining one’s particular mix of intelligences is more an art than a science.8 While Gardner helpfully expands our notion of intelligence, the psychologist Robert J. Sternberg helpfully distills it again. Rather than eight intelligences, Sternberg’s model proposes three: analytical, creative, and practical. Further, unlike Gardner’s theory, Sternberg’s is supported by empirical research.9 One of Sternberg’s studies of particular interest to the question of how we measure intelligence was carried out in rural Kenya, where he and his associates looked at children’s informal knowledge of herbal medicines. Regular use of these medicines is an important part of Kenyans’ daily lives. This knowledge is not taught in schools or assessed by tests, bu","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:35:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Dynamic Testing Robert Sternberg and Elena Grigorenko have proposed the idea of using testing to assess ability in a dynamic manner. Sternberg’s concept of developing expertise holds that with continued experience in a field we are always moving from a lower state of competence to a higher one. His concept also holds that standardized tests can’t accurately rate our potential because what they reveal is limited to a static report of where we are on the learning continuum at the time the test is given. In tandem with Sternberg’s three-part model of intelligence, he and Grigorenko have proposed a shift away from static tests and replacing them with what they call dynamic testing: determining the state of one’s expertise; refocusing learning on areas of low performance; follow-up testing to measure the improvement and to refocus learning so as to keep raising expertise. Thus, a test may assess a weakness, but rather than assuming that the weakness indicates a fixed inability, you interpret it as a lack of skill or knowledge that can be remedied. Dynamic testing has two advantages over standard testing. It focuses the learner and teacher on areas that need to be brought up rather than on areas of accomplishment, and the ability to measure a learner’s progress from one test to the next provides a truer gauge of his or her learning potential. Dynamic testing does not assume one must adapt to some kind of fixed learning limitation but offers an assessment of where one’s knowledge or performance stands on some dimension and how one needs to move forward to succeed: what do I need to learn in order to improve? That is, where aptitude tests and much of learning styles theory tend to emphasize our strengths and encourage us to focus on them, dynamic testing helps us to discover our weaknesses and correct them. In the school of life experience, setbacks show us where we need to do better. We can steer clear of similar challenges in the future, or we can redouble our efforts to master them, broadening our capacities and expertise. Bruce Hendry’s experiences investing in rental property and in the stock market dealt him setbacks, and the lessons he took away were essential elements of his education: to be skeptical when somebody’s trying to sell him something, to figure out the right questions, and to learn how to go dig out the answers. That’s developing expertise. Dynamic testing has three steps. Step 1: a test of some kind—perhaps an experience or a paper exam—shows me where I come up short in knowledge or a skill. Step 2: I dedicate myself to becoming more competent, using reflection, practice, spacing, and the other techniques of effective learning. Step 3: I test myself again, paying attention to what works better now but also, and especially, to where I still need more work. When we take our first steps as toddlers, we are engaging in dynamic testing. When you write your first short story, put it in front of your writers’ group for feedback, and then revise and bring it back, you’re engaging in dynamic testing, learning the writer’s craft and getting a sense of your potential. The upper limits of your performance in any cognitive or manual skill may be set by factors beyond your control, such as your intelligence and the natural limits of your ability, but most of us can learn to perform nearer to our full potential in most areas by discovering our weaknesses and working to bring them up.12 ","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:36:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Structure Building There do appear to be cognitive differences in how we learn, though not the ones recommended by advocates of learning styles. One of these differences is the idea mentioned earlier that psychologists call structure building: the act, as we encounter new material, of extracting the salient ideas and constructing a coherent mental framework out of them. These frameworks are sometimes called mental models or mental maps. High structure-builders learn new material better than low structure-builders. The latter have difficulty setting aside irrelevant or competing information, and as a result they tend to hang on to too many concepts to be condensed into a workable model (or overall structure) that can serve as a foundation for further learning. The theory of structure building bears some resemblance to a village built of Lego blocks. Suppose you’re taking a survey course in a new subject. You start with a textbook full of ideas, and you set out to build a coherent mental model of the knowledge they contain. In our Lego analogy, you start with a box full of Lego pieces, and you set out to build the town that’s pictured on the box cover. You dump out the pieces and sort them into a handful of piles. First you lay out the streets and sidewalks that define the perimeter of the city and the distinct places within it. Then you sort the remaining pieces according to the elements they compose: apartment complex, school, hospital, stadium, mall, fire station. Each of these elements is like a central idea in the textbook, and each takes more shape and nuance as added pieces snap into place. Together, these central ideas form the larger structure of the village. Now suppose that your brother has used this Lego set before and dumped some pieces into the box from another set. As you find pieces, some might not fit with your building blocks, and you can put them aside as extraneous. Or you may discover that some of the new pieces can be used to form a substructure of an existing building block, giving it more depth and definition (porches, patios, and back decks as substructures of apartments; streetlights, hydrants, and boulevard trees as substructures of streets). You happily add these pieces to your village, even though the original designers of the set had not planned on this sort of thing. High structure-builders develop the skill to identify foundational concepts and their key building blocks and to sort new information based on whether it adds to the larger structure and one’s knowledge or is extraneous and can be put aside. By contrast, low structure-builders struggle in figuring out and sticking with an overarching structure and knowing what information needs to fit into it and what ought to be discarded. Structure building is a form of conscious and subconscious discipline: stuff fits or it doesn’t; it adds nuance, capacity and meaning, or it obscures and overfreights. A simpler analogy might be a friend who wants to tell you a rare story about this four-year-old boy she knows: she mentions who the mother is, how they became friends in their book club, finally mentioning that the mother, by coincidence, had a large load of manure delivered for her garden on the morning of the boy’s birthday—the mother’s an incredible gardener, her eggplants took a ribbon at the county fair and got her an interview on morning radio, and she gets her manure from that widowed guy in your church who raises the Clydesdale horses and whose son is married to—and so on and so on. Your friend cannot winnow the main ideas from the blizzard of irrelevant associations, and the story is lost on the listener. Story, too, is structure. Our understanding of structure building as a cognitive difference in learning is still in the early stages: is low structure-building the result of a faulty cognitive mechanism, or is structure-building a skill that some pick up naturally and others must be taught? We know that when questions are embedded in texts t","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:37:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Rule versus Example Learning Another cognitive difference that appears to matter is whether you are a “rule learner” or “example learner,” and the distinction is somewhat akin to the one we just discussed. When studying different kinds of problems in a chemistry class, or specimens in a course on birds and how to identify them, rule learners tend to abstract the underlying principles or “rules” that differentiate the examples being studied. Later, when they encounter a new chemistry problem or bird specimen, they apply the rules as a means to classify it and select the appropriate solution or specimen box. Example learners tend to memorize the examples rather than the underlying principles. When they encounter an unfamiliar case, they lack a grasp of the rules needed to classify or solve it, so they generalize from the nearest example they can remember, even if it is not particularly relevant to the new case. However, example learners may improve at extracting underlying rules when they are asked to compare two different examples rather than focus on studying one example at a time. Likewise, they are more likely to discover the common solution to disparate problems if they first have to compare the problems and try to figure out the underlying similarities. By way of an illustration, consider two different hypothetical problems faced by a learner. These are taken from research into rule learning. In one problem, a general’s forces are set to attack a castle that is protected by a moat. Spies have learned that the bridges over the moat have been mined by the castle’s commander. The mines are set to allow small groups to cross the bridges, so that the occupants of the castle can retrieve food and fuel. How can the general get a large force over the bridges to attack the castle without tripping the mines? The other problem involves an inoperable tumor, which can be destroyed by focused radiation. However, the radiation must also pass through healthy tissue. A beam of sufficient intensity to destroy the tumor will damage the healthy tissue through which it passes. How can the tumor be destroyed without damaging healthy tissue? In the studies, students have difficulty finding the solution to either of these problems unless they are instructed to look for similarities between them. When seeking similarities, many students notice that (1) both problems require a large force to be directed at a target, (2) the full force cannot be massed and delivered through a single route without an adverse outcome, and (3) smaller forces can be delivered to the target, but a small force is insufficient to solve the problem. By identifying these similarities, students often arrive at a strategy of dividing the larger force into smaller forces and sending these in through different routes to converge on the target and destroy it without setting off mines or damaging healthy tissue. Here’s the payoff: after figuring out this common, underlying solution, students are then able to go on to solve a variety of different convergence problems.14 As with high and low structure-builders, our understanding of rule versus example learners is very preliminary. However, we know that high structure-builders and rule learners are more successful in transferring their learning to unfamiliar situations than are low structure-builders and example learners. You might wonder if the tendency to be a high structure-builder is correlated with the tendency to be a rule learner. Unfortunately, research is not yet available to answer this question. You can see the development of structure-building and rule-learning skills in a child’s ability to tell a joke. A three-year-old probably cannot deliver a knock-knock joke, because he lacks an understanding of structure. You reply “Who’s there?” and he jumps to the punch line: “Door is locked, I can’t get in!” He doesn’t understand the importance, after “Who’s there?”, of replying “Doris” to set up the joke. But by the time he’s fi","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:38:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"The Takeaway Given what we know about learning differences, what’s the takeaway? Be the one in charge. There’s an old truism from sales school that says you can’t shoot a deer from the lodge. The same goes for learning: you have to suit up, get out the door, and find what you’re after. Mastery, especially of complex ideas, skills, and processes, is a quest. It is not a grade on a test, something bestowed by a coach, or a quality that simply seeps into your being with old age and gray hair. Embrace the notion of successful intelligence. Go wide: don’t roost in a pigeonhole of your preferred learning style but take command of your resources and tap all of your “intelligences” to master the knowledge or skill you want to possess. Describe what you want to know, do, or accomplish. Then list the competencies required, what you need to learn, and where you can find the knowledge or skill. Then go get it. Consider your expertise to be in a state of continuing development, practice dynamic testing as a learning strategy to discover your weaknesses, and focus on improving yourself in those areas. It’s smart to build on your strengths, but you will become ever more competent and versatile if you also use testing and trial and error to continue to improve in the areas where your knowledge or performance are not pulling their weight. Adopt active learning strategies like retrieval practice, spacing, and interleaving. Be aggressive. Like those with dyslexia who have become high achievers, develop workarounds or compensating skills for impediments or holes in your aptitudes. Don’t rely on what feels best: like a good pilot checking his instruments, use quizzing, peer review, and the other tools described in Chapter 5 to make sure your judgment of what you know and can do is accurate, and that your strategies are moving you toward your goals. Don’t assume that you’re doing something wrong if the learning feels hard. Remember that difficulties you can overcome with greater cognitive effort will more than repay you in the depth and durability of your learning. Distill the underlying principles; build the structure. If you’re an example learner, study examples two at a time or more, rather than one by one, asking yourself in what ways they are alike and different. Are the differences such that they require different solutions, or are the similarities such that they respond to a common solution? Break your idea or desired competency down into its component parts. If you think you are a low structure-builder or an example learner trying to learn new material, pause periodically and ask what the central ideas are, what the rules are. Describe each idea and recall the related points. Which are the big ideas, and which are supporting concepts or nuances? If you were to test yourself on the main ideas, how would you describe them? What kind of scaffold or framework can you imagine that holds these central ideas together? If we borrowed the winding stair metaphor as a structure for Bruce Hendry’s investment model, it might work something like this. Spiral stairs have three parts: a center post, treads, and risers. Let’s say the center post is the thing that connects us from where we are (down here) to where we want to be (up there): it’s the investment opportunity. Each tread is an element of the deal that protects us from losing money and dropping back, and each riser is an element that lifts us up a notch. Treads and risers must both be present for the stairs to function and for a deal to be attractive. Knowing the scrap value of boxcars is a tread—Bruce knows he won’t get less than that for his investment. Another tread is the guaranteed lease income while his capital is tied up. What are some risers? Impending scarcity, which will raise values. The like-new condition of the cars, which is latent value. A deal that doesn’t have treads and risers will not protect the downside or reliably deliver the upside.

The idea that the brain is not hardwired but plastic, mutable, something that reorganizes itself with each new task, is a recent revelation, and we are just at the frontiers of understanding what it means and how it works. In a helpful review of the neuroscience, John T. Bruer took on this question as it relates to the initial development and stabilization of the brain’s circuitry and our ability to bolster the intellectual ability of our children through early stimulation. We’re born with about 100 billion nerve cells, called neurons. A synapse is a connection between neurons, enabling them to pass signals. For a period shortly before and after birth, we undergo “an exuberant burst of synapse formation,” in which the brain wires itself: the neurons sprout microscopic branches, called axons, that reach out in search of tiny nubs on other neurons, called dendrites. When axon meets dendrite, a synapse is formed. In order for some axons to find their target dendrites they must travel vast distances to complete the connections that make up our neural circuitry (a journey of such daunting scale and precision that Bruer likens it to finding one’s way clear across the United States to a waiting partner on the opposite coast, not unlike Kit Carson’s mission to President Polk for General Fremont). It’s this circuitry that enables our senses, cognition, and motor skills, including learning and memory, and it is this circuitry that forms the possibilities and the limits of one’s intellectual capacity. The number of synapses peaks at the age of one or two, at about 50 percent higher than the average number we possess as adults. A plateau period follows that lasts until around puberty, whereupon this overabundance begins to decline as the brain goes through a period of synaptic pruning. We arrive at our adult complement at around age sixteen with a staggering number, thought to total about 150 trillion connections. We don’t know why the infant brain produces an overabundance of connections or how it subsequently determines which ones to prune. Some neuroscientists believe that the connections we don’t use are the ones that fade and die away, a notion that would seem to manifest the “use it or lose it” principle and argue for the early stimulation of as many connections as possible in hopes of retaining them for life. Another theory suggests the burgeoning and winnowing is determined by genetics and we have little or no influence over which synapses survive and which do not. “While children’s brains acquire a tremendous amount of information during the early years,” the neuroscientist Patricia Goldman-Rakic told the Education Commission of the States, most learning is acquired after synaptic formation stabilizes. “From the time a child enters first grade, through high school, college, and beyond, there is little change in the number of synapses. It is during the time when no, or little, synapse formation occurs that most learning takes place” and we develop adult-level skills in language, mathematics, and logic.3 And it is likely during this period more than during infancy, in the view of the neuroscientist Harry T. Chugani, that experience and environmental stimulation fine-tune one’s circuits and make one’s neuronal architecture unique.4 In a 2011 article, a team of British academics in the fields of psychology and sociology reviewed the evidence from neuroscience and concluded that the architecture and gross structure of the brain appear to be substantially determined by genes but that the fine structure of neural networks appears to be shaped by experience and to be capable of substantial modification.5 That the brain is mutable has become evident on many fronts.

IQ is a product of genes and environment. Compare it to height: it’s mostly inherited, but over the decades as nutrition has improved, subsequent generations have grown taller. Likewise, IQs in every industrialized part of the world have shown a sustained rise since the start of standardized sampling in 1932, a phenomenon called the Flynn effect after the political scientist who first brought it to wide attention.11 In the United States, the average IQ has risen eighteen points in the last sixty years. For any given age group, an IQ of 100 is the mean score of those taking the IQ tests, so the increase means that having an IQ of 100 today is the intelligence equivalent of those with an IQ 60 years ago of 118. It’s the mean that has risen, and there are several theories why this is so, the principal one being that schools, culture (e.g., television), and nutrition have changed substantially in ways that affect people’s verbal and math abilities as measured by the subtests that make up the IQ test. Richard Nisbett, in his book Intelligence and How to Get It, discusses the pervasiveness of stimuli in modern society that didn’t exist years ago, offering as one simple example a puzzle maze McDonald’s included in its Happy Meals a few years ago that was more difficult than the mazes included in an IQ test for gifted children.12 Nisbett also writes about “environmental multipliers,” suggesting that a tall kid who goes out for basketball develops a proficiency in the sport that a shorter kid with the same aptitudes won’t develop, just as a curious kid who goes for learning gets smarter than the equally bright but incurious kid who doesn’t. The options for learning have expanded exponentially. It may be a very small genetic difference that makes one kid more curious than another, but the effect is multiplied in an environment where curiosity is easily piqued and readily satisfied. Another environmental factor that shapes IQ is socioeconomic status and the increased stimulation and nurturing that are more generally available in families who have more resources and education. On average, children from affluent families test higher for IQ than children from impoverished families, and children from impoverished families who are adopted into affluent families score higher on IQ tests than those who are not, regardless of whether the birth parents were of high or low socioeconomic status. The ability to raise IQ is fraught with controversy and the subject of countless studies reflecting wide disparities of scientific rigor. A comprehensive review published in 2013 of the extant research into raising intelligence in young children sheds helpful light on the issue, in part because of the strict criteria the authors established for determining which studies would qualify for consideration. The eligible studies had to draw from a general, nonclinical population; have a randomized, experimental design; consist of sustained interventions, not of one-shot treatments or simply of manipulations during the testing experience; and use a widely accepted, standardized measure of intelligence. The authors focused on experiments involving children from the prenatal period through age five, and the studies meeting their requirements involved over 37,000 participants. What did they find? Nutrition affects IQ. Providing dietary supplements of fatty acids to pregnant women, breast-feeding women, and infants had the effect of increasing IQ by anywhere from 3.5 to 6.5 points. Certain fatty acids provide building blocks for nerve cell development that the body cannot produce by itself, and the theory behind the results is that these supplements support the creation of new synapses. Studies of other supplements, such as iron and B complex vitamins, strongly suggested benefits, but these need validation through further research before they can be considered definitive.

These products are largely founded on the findings of one Swiss study, reported in 2008, which was very limited in scope and has not been replicated.14 The study focused on improving “fluid intelligence”: the facility for abstract reasoning, grasping unfamiliar relationships, and solving new kinds of problems. Fluid intelligence is one of two kinds of intelligence that make up IQ. The other is crystallized intelligence, the storehouse of knowledge we have accumulated through the years. It’s clear that we can increase our crystallized intelligence through effective learning and memory strategies, but what about our fluid intelligence? A key determiner of fluid intelligence is the capacity of a person’s working memory—the number of new ideas and relationships that a person can hold in mind while working through a problem (especially with some amount of distraction). The focus of the Swiss study was to give participants tasks requiring increasingly difficult working memory challenges, holding two different stimuli in mind for progressively longer periods of distraction. One stimulus was a sequence of numerals. The other was a small square of light that appeared in varying locations on a screen. Both the numerals and the locations of the square changed every three seconds. The task was to decide—while viewing a sequence of changed numerals and repositioned squares—for each combination of numeral and square, whether it matched a combination that had been presented n items back in the series. The number n increased during the trials, making the challenge to working memory progressively more arduous. All the participants were tested on fluid intelligence tasks at the outset of the study. Then they were given these increasingly difficult exercises of their working memory over periods ranging up to nineteen days. At the end of the training, they were retested for fluid intelligence. They all performed better than they had before the training, and those who had engaged in the training for the longest period showed the greatest improvement. These results showed for the first time that fluid intelligence can be increased through training. What’s the criticism? The participants were few (only thirty-five) and were all recruited from a similar, highly intelligent population. Moreover, the study focused on only one training task, so it is unclear to what extent it might apply to other working-memory training tasks, or whether the results are really about working memory rather than some peculiarity of the particular training. Finally, the durability of the improved performance is unknown, and the results, as noted, have not been replicated by other studies. The ability to replicate empirical results is the bedrock of scientific theory. The website PsychFileDrawer.org keeps a list of the top twenty psychological research studies that the site’s users would like to see replicated, and the Swiss study is the first on the list. A recent attempt whose results were published in 2013 failed to find any improvements to fluid intelligence as a result of replicating the exercises in the Swiss study. Interestingly, participants in the study believed that their mental capacities had been enhanced, a phenomenon the authors describe as illusory. However, the authors also acknowledge that an increased sense of self-efficacy can lead to greater persistence in solving difficult problems, encouraged by the belief that training has improved one’s abilities.15 The brain is not a muscle, so strengthening one skill does not automatically strengthen others. Learning and memory strategies such as retrieval practice and the building of mental models are effective for enhancing intellectual abilities in the material or skills practiced, but the benefits don’t exten","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:42:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Growth Mindset Let’s return to the old saw “If you think you can, or you think you can’t, you’re right.” If turns out there is more truth here than wit. Attitude counts for a lot. The studies of the psychologist Carol Dweck have gotten huge attention for showing just how big an impact one simple conviction can have on learning and performance: the belief that your level of intellectual ability is not fixed but rests to a large degree in your own hands.16 Dweck and her colleagues have replicated and expanded on their results in many studies. In one of the early experiments, she ran a workshop for low-performing seventh graders at a New York City junior high school, teaching them about the brain and about effective study techniques. Half the group also received a presentation on memory, but the other half were given an explanation of how the brain changes as a result of effortful learning: that when you try hard and learn something new, the brain forms new connections, and these new connections, over time, make you smarter. This group was told that intellectual development is not the natural unfolding of intelligence but results from the new connections that are formed through effort and learning. After the workshop, both groups of kids filtered back into their classwork. Their teachers were unaware that some had been taught that effortful learning changes the brain, but as the school year unfolded, those students adopted what Dweck calls a “growth mindset,” a belief that their intelligence was largely within their own control, and they went on to become much more aggressive learners and higher achievers than students from the first group, who continued to hold the conventional view, what Dweck calls a “fixed mindset,” that their intellectual ability was set at birth by the natural talents they were born with. Dweck’s research had been triggered by her curiosity over why some people become helpless when they encounter challenges and fail at them, whereas others respond to failure by trying new strategies and redoubling their effort. She found that a fundamental difference between the two responses lies in how a person attributes failure: those who attribute failure to their own inability—“I’m not intelligent”—become helpless. Those who interpret failure as the result of insufficient effort or an ineffective strategy dig deeper and try different approaches. Dweck came to see that some students aim at performance goals, while others strive toward learning goals. In the first case, you’re working to validate your ability. In the second, you’re working to acquire new knowledge or skills. People with performance goals unconsciously limit their potential. If your focus is on validating or showing off your ability, you pick challenges you are confident you can meet. You want to look smart, so you do the same stunt over and over again. But if your goal is to increase your ability, you pick ever-increasing challenges, and you interpret setbacks as useful information that helps you to sharpen your focus, get more creative, and work harder. “If you want to demonstrate something over and over, ‘ability’ feels like something static that lies inside of you, whereas if you want to increase your ability, it feels dynamic and malleable,” Dweck says. Learning goals trigger entirely different chains of thought and action from performance goals.17 Paradoxically, a focus on performance trips up some star athletes. Praised for being “naturals,” they believe their performance is a result of innate gifts. If they’re naturals, the idea goes, they shouldn’t have to work hard to excel, and in fact many simply avoid practicing, because a need to practice is public evidence that their natural gifts are not good enough to cut the mustard after all. A focus on performance instead of on learning and growing causes people to hold back from risk taking or exposing their self-image to ridicule by putting themselves into situations where they have to break a sweat","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:43:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Deliberate Practice When you see stellar performances by an expert in any field—a pianist, chess player, golfer—perhaps you marvel at what natural talent must underlie their abilities, but expert performance does not usually rise out of some genetic predisposition or IQ advantage. It rises from thousands of hours of what Anders Ericsson calls sustained deliberate practice. If doing something repeatedly might be considered practice, deliberate practice is a different animal: it’s goal directed, often solitary, and consists of repeated striving to reach beyond your current level of performance. Whatever the field, expert performance is thought to be garnered through the slow acquisition of a larger number of increasingly complex patterns, patterns that are used to store knowledge about which actions to take in a vast vocabulary of different situations. Witness a champion chess player. In studying the positions on a board, he can contemplate many alternative moves and the countless different directions each might precipitate. The striving, failure, problem solving, and renewed attempts that characterize deliberate practice build the new knowledge, physiological adaptations, and complex mental models required to attain ever higher levels. When Michelangelo finally completed painting over 400 life size figures on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, he is reported to have written, “If people knew how hard I worked to get my mastery, it wouldn’t seem so wonderful after all.” What appeared to his admirers to have flowed from sheer genius had required four torturous years of work and dedication.20 Deliberate practice usually isn’t enjoyable, and for most learners it requires a coach or trainer who can help identify areas of performance that need to be improved, help focus attention on specific aspects, and provide feedback to keep perception and judgment accurate. The effort and persistence of deliberate practice remodel the brain and physiology to accommodate higher performance, but achieving expertise in any field is particular to the field. It does not confer some kind of advantage or head start toward gaining expertise in another domain. A simple example of practice remodeling the brain is the treatment of focal hand dystonia, a syndrome affecting some guitarists and pianists whose repetitive playing has rewired their brains to think that two fingers have been fused into one. Through a series of challenging exercises, they can be helped gradually to retrain their fingers to move separately. One reason that experts are sometimes perceived to possess an uncanny talent is that some can observe a complex performance in their field and later reconstruct from memory every aspect of that performance, in granular detail. Mozart was famous for being able to reconstruct complex musical scores after a single hearing. But this skill, Ericsson says, rises not out of some sixth sense but from an expert’s superior perception and memory within his domain, which are the result of years of acquired skill and knowledge in that domain. Most people who achieve expertise in a field are destined to remain average performers in the other realms of life. Ten thousand hours or ten years of practice was the average time the people Ericsson studied had invested to become expert in their fields, and the best among them had spent the larger percentage of those hours in solitary, deliberate practice. The central idea here is that expert performance is a product of the quantity and the quality of practice, not of genetic predisposition, and that becoming expert is not beyond the reach of normally gifted people who have the motivation, time, and discipline to pursue it.

(Mnemosyne, one of the nine Muses of Greek mythology, was the goddess of memory.) Some examples of simple mnemonic devices are acronyms, like “ROY G BIV” for the colors of the rainbow, and reverse acronyms, as in “I Value Xylophones Like Cows Dig Milk” for the ascending value of Roman numerals from 1 to 1000 (e.g., V = 5; D = 500). A memory palace is a more complex type of mnemonic device that is useful for organizing and holding larger volumes of material in memory. It’s based on the method of loci, which goes back to the ancient Greeks and involves associating mental images with a series of physical locations to help cue memories. For example, you imagine yourself within a space that is very familiar to you, like your home, and then you associate prominent features of the space, like your easy chair, with a visual image of something you want to remember. (When you think of your easy chair you may picture a limber yogi sitting there, to remind you to renew your yoga lessons.) The features of your home can be associated with a countless number of visual cues for retrieving memories later, when you simply take an imaginary walk through the house. If it’s important to recall the material in a certain order, the cues can be sequenced along the route through your house. (The method of loci is also used to associate cues with features you encounter along a very familiar journey, like your walk to the corner store.) As we write this passage, a group of students in Oxford, England, are constructing memory palaces to prepare for their A-level exams in psychology. Every week for six weeks, they and their instructor have visited a different café in town, where they have relaxed over coffee, familiarized themselves with the layout of the place, and discussed how they might imagine it occupied with vivid characters who will cue from memory important aspects of psychology that they will need to write about at exam time. We’ll come back to these students, but first a few more words about this technique, which is surprisingly effective and derives from the way imagery serves to contribute vividness and connective links to memory. Humans remember pictures more easily than words. (For example, the image of an elephant is easier to recall than the word “elephant.”) So it stands to reason that associating vivid mental images with verbal or abstract material makes that material easier to retrieve from memory. A strong mental image can prove as secure and bountiful as a loaded stringer of fish. Tug on it, and a whole day’s catch comes to the surface. When a friend is reminding you of a conversation with somebody the two of you met on a trip, you struggle to recall it. She tells you where the discussion happened, and you picture the place. Ah, yes, it all comes flooding back. Images cue memories.21 Mark Twain wrote about his personal experiences with this phenomenon in an article published by Harper’s. In his days on the speaking circuit, Twain used a list of partial sentences to prompt himself through the different phases of his remarks, but he found the system unsatisfactory—when you glance at snippets of text, they all look alike. He experimented with alternatives, finally hitting on the idea of outlining his speech in a series of crude pencil sketches. The sketches did the job. A haystack with a snake under it told him where to start his story about his adventures in Nevada’s Carson Valley. An umbrella tilted against a stiff wind took him to the next part of his story, the fierce winds that blew down out of the Sierras at about two o’clock every afternoon. And so on. The power of these sketches to evoke memory impressed Twain and gave rise one day to an idea for helping his children, who were still struggling to learn the kings and queens of England, despite long hours invested by their nanny in trying to hammer the names and ","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:45:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"The Takeaway It comes down to the simple but no less profound truth that effortful learning changes the brain, building new connections and capability. This single fact—that our intellectual abilities are not fixed from birth but are, to a considerable degree, ours to shape—is a resounding answer to the nagging voice that too often asks us “Why bother?” We make the effort because the effort itself extends the boundaries of our abilities. What we do shapes who we become and what we’re capable of doing. The more we do, the more we can do. To embrace this principle and reap its benefits is to be sustained through life by a growth mindset. And it comes down to the simple fact that the path to complex mastery or expert performance does not necessarily start from exceptional genes, but it most certainly entails self-discipline, grit, and persistence; with these qualities in healthy measure, if you want to become an expert, you probably can. And whatever you are striving to master, whether it’s a poem you wrote for a friend’s birthday, the concept of classical conditioning in psychology, or the second violin part in Hayden’s Fifth Symphony, conscious mnemonic devices can help to organize and cue the learning for ready retrieval until sustained, deliberate practice and repeated use form the deeper encoding and subconscious mastery that characterize expert performance. 8 Make It Stick NO MATTER WHAT YOU MAY set your sights on doing or becoming, if you want to be a contender, it’s mastering the ability to learn that will get you in the game and keep you there. In the preceding chapters, we resisted the temptation to become overtly prescriptive, feeling that if we laid out the big ideas from the empirical research and illustrated them well through examples, you could reach your own conclusions about how best to apply them. But early readers of those chapters urged us to get specific with practical advice. So we do that here. We start with tips for students, thinking in particular of high school, college, and graduate school students. Then we speak to lifelong learners, to teachers, and finally to trainers. While the fundamental principles are consistent across these groups, the settings, life stages, and learning materials differ. To help you envision how to apply these tips, we tell the stories of several people who, one way or another, have already found their way to these strategies and are using them to great effect.

You may not have been taught how to do this, but you can do it, and you will likely surprise yourself with the results. Embrace the fact that significant learning is often, or even usually, somewhat difficult. You will experience setbacks. These are signs of effort, not of failure. Setbacks come with striving, and striving builds expertise. Effortful learning changes your brain, making new connections, building mental models, increasing your capability. The implication of this is powerful: Your intellectual abilities lie to a large degree within your own control. Knowing that this is so makes the difficulties worth tackling. Following are three keystone study strategies. Make a habit of them and structure your time so as to pursue them with regularity. Practice Retrieving New Learning from Memory What does this mean? “Retrieval practice” means self-quizzing. Retrieving knowledge and skill from memory should become your primary study strategy in place of rereading. How to use retrieval practice as a study strategy: When you read a text or study lecture notes, pause periodically to ask yourself questions like these, without looking in the text: What are the key ideas? What terms or ideas are new to me? How would I define them? How do the ideas relate to what I already know? Many textbooks have study questions at the ends of the chapters, and these are good fodder for self-quizzing. Generating questions for yourself and writing down the answers is also a good way to study. Set aside a little time every week throughout the semester to quiz yourself on the material in a course, both the current week’s work and material covered in prior weeks. When you quiz yourself, check your answers to make sure that your judgments of what you know and don’t know are accurate. Use quizzing to identify areas of weak mastery, and focus your studying to make them strong. The harder it is for you to recall new learning from memory, the greater the benefit of doing so. Making errors will not set you back, so long as you check your answers and correct your mistakes. What your intuition tells you to do: Most studiers focus on underlining and highlighting text and lecture notes and slides. They dedicate their time to rereading these, becoming fluent in the text and terminology, because this feels like learning. Why retrieval practice is better: After one or two reviews of a text, self-quizzing is far more potent for learning than additional rereading. Why might this be so? This is explained more fully in Chapter 2 , but here are some of the high points. The familiarity with a text that is gained from rereading creates illusions of knowing, but these are not reliable indicators of mastery of the material. Fluency with a text has two strikes against it: it is a misleading indicator of what you have learned, and it creates the false impression that you will remember the material. By contrast, quizzing yourself on the main ideas and the meanings behind the terms helps you to focus on the central precepts rather than on peripheral material or on a professor’s turn of phrase. Quizzing provides a reliable measure of what you’ve learned and what you haven’t yet mastered. Moreover, quizzing arrests forgetting. Forgetting is human nature, but practice at recalling new learning secures it in memory and helps you recall it in the future. Periodically practicing new knowledge and skills through self-quizzing strengthens your learning of it and your ability to connect it to prior knowledge. A habit of regular retrieval practice throughout the duration of a course puts an end to cramming and all-nighters. You will need little studying at exam time. Reviewing the material the night before is much easier than learning it. How it feels: Compared to rereading, self-quizzing can feel awkward and frustrating, espe","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:47:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Tips for Lifelong Learners The learning strategies we have just outlined for students are effective for anyone at any age. But they are centered around classroom instruction. Lifelong learners are using the same principles in a variety of less-structured settings. In a sense, of course, we’re all lifelong learners. From the moment we’re born we start learning about the world around us through experimentation, trial and error, and random encounters with challenges that require us to recall what we did the last time we found ourselves in a similar circumstance. In other words, the techniques of generation, spaced practice and the like that we present in this book are organic (even if counterintuitive), and it’s not surprising that many people have already discovered their power in the pursuit of interests and careers that require continuous learning. Retrieval Practice Nathaniel Fuller is a professional actor with the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. We took an interest in him after a dinner party where the Guthrie’s renowned artistic director, Joe Dowling, on hearing of our work, immediately suggested we interview Fuller. It seems that Fuller has the capacity to so fully learn the lines and movements of a role for which he is understudy that he can go onstage at the last moment with great success, despite not having had the benefit of learning and rehearsing it in the normal way. Fuller is a consummate professional of the stage, having refined his techniques for learning roles over many years. He is often cast in a leading role; at other times, he may play several lesser characters in a play while also understudying the lead. How does he do it? When he starts with a new script, Fuller puts it into a binder, goes through it, and highlights all of his lines. “I figure out how much I’ve got to learn. I try to estimate how much I can learn in a day, and then I try to start early enough to get that learned.”3 Highlighting his lines also makes them easy to find and gives him a sense of the construction, so this use of highlighting is rather different from what students do in class when they highlight merely for purposes of rereading. “You get the shape of the line, and how the back-and-forth works.” Fuller uses retrieval practice in various forms. First, he takes a blank sheet of paper and covers a page of the script. He draws it down, silently rendering the lines of the characters he’s playing opposite, because those lines cue his own, and the emotion in them is reflected one way or another by his own character. He keeps his own line covered and attempts to speak it aloud from memory. He checks his accuracy. If he gets the line wrong, he covers it up and speaks it again. When he has spoken it correctly, he reveals the next passage and goes on. “Half of knowing your part is not just what to say, but knowing when to say it. I don’t have an exceptional brain for memorizing, but one of the keys I’ve found is, I need to try my best to say the line without looking at it. I need to have that struggle in order to make myself remember it. “I’ll work like crazy. When I get to where it feels like diminishing returns, I’ll quit. Then I’ll come back the next day, and I won’t remember it. That’s where a lot of my friends will panic. I just have faith now that it’s in there, it’s going to come back a little bit better the next time. Then I’ll work on a new chunk, until I get to the end of the play.” As he progresses through the script, he’s constantly moving from familiar pages and scenes into newer material, the play taking shape like threads added to a growing tapestry, each scene given meaning by those that came before and extending the story in turn. When he reaches the end, he practices in reverse order, moving from the less familiar last scene to practice the more familiar one that precedes it and then continuing on through the last scene again. Then he goes to the part preceding both of those scenes and practices through to the end.

Every teacher must find what’s right in his or her classroom. Yet specifics can be helpful. So here are some basic strategies that in our judgment will go a long way toward helping students become stronger learners in the classroom. Brief descriptions follow of what some teachers are already doing along these lines. Between the recommendations and the examples, we hope you will find practical ideas you can adapt and put to work. Explain to Students How Learning Works Students labor under many myths and illusions about learning that cause them to make some unfortunate choices about intellectual risk taking and about when and how to study. It’s the proper role of the teacher to explain what empirical studies have discovered about how people learn, so the student can better manage his or her own education. In particular, students must be helped to understand such fundamental ideas as these: • Some kinds of difficulties during learning help to make the learning stronger and better remembered. • When learning is easy, it is often superficial and soon forgotten. • Not all of our intellectual abilities are hardwired. In fact, when learning is effortful, it changes the brain, making new connections and increasing intellectual ability. • You learn better when you wrestle with new problems before being shown the solution, rather than the other way around. • To achieve excellence in any sphere, you must strive to surpass your current level of ability. • Striving, by its nature, often results in setbacks, and setbacks are often what provide the essential information needed to adjust strategies to achieve mastery. These topics, woven throughout the book, are discussed in depth in Chapters 4 and 7 . Teach Students How to Study Students generally are not taught how to study, and when they are, they often get the wrong advice. As a result, they gravitate to activities that are far from optimal, like rereading, massed practice, and cramming. At the beginning of this chapter we present effective study strategies. Students will benefit from teachers who help them understand these strategies and stick with them long enough to experience their benefits, which may initially appear doubtful. Create Desirable Difficulties in the Classroom Where practical, use frequent quizzing to help students consolidate learning and interrupt the process of forgetting. Make the ground rules acceptable to your students and yourself. Students find quizzing more acceptable when it is predictable and the stakes for any individual quiz are low. Teachers find quizzing more acceptable when it is simple, quick, and does not lead to negotiating makeup quizzes. (For one example, consider the way Kathleen McDermott, whose work we describe below, uses daily quizzing in her university class on human learning and memory.) Create study tools that incorporate retrieval practice, generation, and elaboration. These might be exercises that require students to wrestle with trying to solve a new kind of problem before coming to the class where the solution is taught; practice tests that students can download and use to review material and to calibrate their judgments of what they know and don’t know; writing exercises that require students to reflect on past lesson material and relate it to other knowledge or other aspects of their lives; exercises that require students to generate short statements that summarize the key ideas of recent material covered in a text or lecture. Make quizzing and practice exercises count toward the course grade, even if for very low stakes. Students in classes where practice exercises carry consequences for the course grade learn better than those in classes where the exercises are the same but carry no consequences. Design quizzing and exercises to reach back to concepts and learning covered earlier in the term, so that retrieval practice continues and the learning is cumulative, helping","date":"2022-02-18","objectID":"/en/make_it_stick/:49:0","tags":["学习","learn","skill","self-learning"],"title":"Make it Stick","uri":"/en/make_it_stick/"},{"categories":["skill","learning"],"content":"Tips for Trainers Here are some ways trainers are using the same principles as those who teach in schools, in a variety of less structured and nonclassroom settings. In-Service Training Licensed professionals in many fields must earn continuing education credits to keep their skills current and maintain their licenses. As the pediatric neurologist Doug Larsen describes in Chapter 3 , this kind of training for doctors is typically compressed into a weekend symposium, out of respect for participants’ busy schedules, set at a hotel or resort, and structured around meals and PowerPoint lectures. In other words, the strategies of retrieval practice, spacing, and interleaving are nowhere to be seen. Participants are lucky to retain much of what they learn. If you see yourself in this scenario, there are a few things you might consider doing. One, get a copy of the presentation materials and use them to quiz yourself on the key ideas, much as Nathaniel Fuller quizzes himself on the arc of a play, his lines, the many layers of character. Two, schedule follow-up emails to appear in your inbox every month or so with questions that require you to retrieve the critical learning you gained from the seminar. Three, contact your professional association and ask them to consider revamping their approach to training along the lines outlined in this book. The testing effect forms the basis of a new commercial training platform called Qstream that helps trainers send learners periodic quizzes via their mobile devices to strengthen learning through spaced retrieval practice. Similarly, an emerging platform called Osmosis uses mobile and Web based software to provide learners access to thousands of crowdsourced practice questions and explanations. Osmosis combines the testing effect, spacing, and social networking to facilitate what its developers call “student-driven social learning.” Qstream (qstream.com ) and Osmosis (osmose-it.com ) suggest interesting possibilities for redesigning in-service training for professionals. Many other companies are developing similar programs. Kathy Maixner, Business Coach The Maixner Group is a consulting shop based in Portland, Oregon, that helps companies identify growth strategies and improve their sales tactics. Kathy Maixner fries big fish and little. One of the big fish added $21 million to its annual revenue as a result of hooking up with Maixner. One of the small ones, Inner Gate Acupuncture (profiled at the close of this chapter), learned how to establish a solid business management footing under a clinical practice whose growth was outpacing its control systems. We’re interested in Maixner because the coaching techniques she has developed over her career line up so well with the learning principles described in this book. In short, Maixner sees her role as helping the client dig past the symptoms of a problem to discover its root causes, and then to generate possible solutions and play out the implications of different strategies before committing to them. Maixner told us: “If you hand people the solution, they don’t need to explore how you got to that solution. If they generate the solution, then they’re the ones who are traveling down that road. Should they go left or right? We discuss the options.”11 Maixner’s years of experience working with clients in many different fields helps her see around corners, where the hazards lie. She often uses role-playing to simulate problems, getting her clients to generate solutions, try them out, get feedback, and practice what works. In other words, she introduces the difficulties that make the learning stronger and more accurately reflect what the client will encounter out in the marketplace.

The first thing to understand is that hackers actually like hard problems and good, thought-provoking questions about them. If we didn’t, we wouldn’t be here. If you give us an interesting question to chew on we’ll be grateful to you; good questions are a stimulus and a gift. Good questions help us develop our understanding, and often reveal problems we might not have noticed or thought about otherwise. Among hackers, “Good question!” is a strong and sincere compliment. Despite this, hackers have a reputation for meeting simple questions with what looks like hostility or arrogance. It sometimes looks like we’re reflexively rude to newbies and the ignorant. But this isn’t really true. What we are, unapologetically, is hostile to people who seem to be unwilling to think or to do their own homework before asking questions. People like that are time sinks — they take without giving back, and they waste time we could have spent on another question more interesting and another person more worthy of an answer. We call people like this “losers” (and for historical reasons we sometimes spell it “lusers”). We realize that there are many people who just want to use the software we write, and who have no interest in learning technical details. For most people, a computer is merely a tool, a means to an end; they have more important things to do and lives to live. We acknowledge that, and don’t expect everyone to take an interest in the technical matters that fascinate us. Nevertheless, our style of answering questions is tuned for people who do take such an interest and are willing to be active participants in problem-solving. That’s not going to change. Nor should it; if it did, we would become less effective at the things we do best. We’re (largely) volunteers. We take time out of busy lives to answer questions, and at times we’re overwhelmed with them. So we filter ruthlessly. In particular, we throw away questions from people who appear to be losers in order to spend our question-answering time more efficiently, on winners. If you find this attitude obnoxious, condescending, or arrogant, check your assumptions. We’re not asking you to genuflect to us — in fact, most of us would love nothing more than to deal with you as an equal and welcome you into our culture, if you put in the effort required to make that possible. But it’s simply not efficient for us to try to help people who are not willing to help themselves. It’s OK to be ignorant; it’s not OK to play stupid. So, while it isn’t necessary to already be technically competent to get attention from us, it is necessary to demonstrate the kind of attitude that leads to competence — alert, thoughtful, observant, willing to be an active partner in developing a solution. If you can’t live with this sort of discrimination, we suggest you pay somebody for a commercial support contract instead of asking hackers to personally donate help to you. If you decide to come to us for help, you don’t want to be one of the losers. You don’t want to seem like one, either. The best way to get a rapid and responsive answer is to ask it like a person with smarts, confidence, and clues who just happens to need help on one particular problem.

Try to find an answer by searching the Web. Try to find an answer by reading the manual. Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ. Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation. Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend. If you’re a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code. When you ask your question, display the fact that you have done these things first; this will help establish that you’re not being a lazy sponge and wasting people’s time. Better yet, display what you have learned from doing these things. We like answering questions for people who have demonstrated they can learn from the answers. Use tactics like doing a Google search on the text of whatever error message you get (searching Google groups as well as Web pages). This might well take you straight to fix documentation or a mailing list thread answering your question. Even if it doesn’t, saying “I googled on the following phrase but didn’t get anything that looked promising” is a good thing to do in e-mail or news postings requesting help, if only because it records what searches won’t help. It will also help to direct other people with similar problems to your thread by linking the search terms to what will hopefully be your problem and resolution thread. Take your time. Do not expect to be able to solve a complicated problem with a few seconds of Googling. Read and understand the FAQs, sit back, relax and give the problem some thought before approaching experts. Trust us, they will be able to tell from your questions how much reading and thinking you did, and will be more willing to help if you come prepared. Don’t instantly fire your whole arsenal of questions just because your first search turned up no answers (or too many). Prepare your question. Think it through. Hasty-sounding questions get hasty answers, or none at all. The more you do to demonstrate that having put thought and effort into solving your problem before seeking help, the more likely you are to actually get help. Beware of asking the wrong question. If you ask one that is based on faulty assumptions, J. Random Hacker is quite likely to reply with a uselessly literal answer while thinking “Stupid question…”, and hoping the experience of getting what you asked for rather than what you needed will teach you a lesson. Never assume you are entitled to an answer. You are not; you aren’t, after all, paying for the service. You will earn an answer, if you earn it, by asking a substantial, interesting, and thought-provoking question — one that implicitly contributes to the experience of the community rather than merely passively demanding knowledge from others. On the other hand, making it clear that you are able and willing to help in the process of developing the solution is a very good start. “Would someone provide a pointer?”, “What is my example missing?”, and “What site should I have checked?” are more likely to get answered than “Please post the exact procedure I should use.” because you’re making it clear that you’re truly willing to complete the process if someone can just point you in the right direction.

You are likely to be ignored, or written off as a loser, if you: post your question to a forum where it’s off topic post a very elementary question to a forum where advanced technical questions are expected, or vice-versa cross-post to too many different newsgroups post a personal e-mail to somebody who is neither an acquaintance of yours nor personally responsible for solving your problem Hackers blow off questions that are inappropriately targeted in order to try to protect their communications channels from being drowned in irrelevance. You don’t want this to happen to you. The first step, therefore, is to find the right forum. Again, Google and other Web-searching methods are your friend. Use them to find the project webpage most closely associated with the hardware or software giving you difficulties. Usually it will have links to a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) list, and to project mailing lists and their archives. These mailing lists are the final places to go for help, if your own efforts (including reading those FAQs you found) do not find you a solution. The project page may also describe a bug-reporting procedure, or have a link to one; if so, follow it. Shooting off an e-mail to a person or forum which you are not familiar with is risky at best. For example, do not assume that the author of an informative webpage wants to be your free consultant. Do not make optimistic guesses about whether your question will be welcome — if you’re unsure, send it elsewhere, or refrain from sending it at all. When selecting a Web forum, newsgroup or mailing list, don’t trust the name by itself too far; look for a FAQ or charter to verify your question is on-topic. Read some of the back traffic before posting so you’ll get a feel for how things are done there. In fact, it’s a very good idea to do a keyword search for words relating to your problem on the newsgroup or mailing list archives before you post. It may find you an answer, and if not it will help you formulate a better question. Don’t shotgun-blast all the available help channels at once, that’s like yelling and irritates people. Step through them softly. Know what your topic is! One of the classic mistakes is asking questions about the Unix or Windows programming interface in a forum devoted to a language or library or tool portable across both. If you don’t understand why this is a blunder, you’d be best off not asking any questions at all until you get it. In general, questions to a well-selected public forum are more likely to get useful answers than equivalent questions to a private one. There are multiple reasons for this. One is simply the size of the pool of potential respondents. Another is the size of the audience; hackers would rather answer questions that educate many people than questions serving only a few. Understandably, skilled hackers and authors of popular software are already receiving more than their fair share of mis-targeted messages. By adding to the flood, you could in extreme cases even be the straw that breaks the camel’s back — quite a few times, contributors to popular projects have withdrawn their support because collateral damage in the form of useless e-mail traffic to their personal accounts became unbearable.

Start with a Google search before looking at Stack Exchange; Google indexes it in real time. There’s a very good chance someone has already asked a similar question, and the Stack Exchange sites are often near the top of the search results. If you didn’t find anything through Google, search again on the specific site most relevant to your question (see below). Searching with tags can help narrow down the results. If you still didn’t find anything, post your question on the one site where it’s most on-topic. Use the formatting tools, especially for code, and add tags that are related to the substance of your question (particularly the name of the programming language, operating system, or library you’re having trouble with). If a commenter asks you for more information, edit your main post to include it. If any answer is helpful, click the up arrow to upvote it; if an answer gives a solution to your problem, click the check under the voting arrows to accept it as correct. Stack Exchange has grown to over 100 sites , but here are the most likely candidates: Super User is for questions about general-purpose computing. If your question isn’t about code or programs that you talk to only over a network connection, it probably goes here. Stack Overflow is for questions about programming. Server Fault is for questions about server and network administration. Several projects have their own specific sites, including Android, Ubuntu, TeX/LaTeX, and SharePoint.

(In non-English-speaking countries newbie forums are still more likely to be mailing lists.) These are good first places to ask, especially if you think you may have tripped over a relatively simple or common problem. An advertised IRC channel is an open invitation to ask questions there and often get answers in real time. In fact, if you got the program that is giving you problems from a Linux distribution (as is common today), it may be better to ask in the distro’s forum/list before trying the program’s project forum/list. The project’s hackers may just say, “use our build”. Before posting to any Web forum, check if it has a Search feature. If it does, try a couple of keyword searches for something like your problem; it just might help. If you did a general Web search before (as you should have), search the forum anyway; your Web-wide search engine might not have all of this forum indexed recently. There is an increasing tendency for projects to do user support over a Web forum or IRC channel, with e-mail reserved more for development traffic. So look for those channels first when seeking project-specific help. In IRC, it’s probably best not to dump a long problem description on the channel first thing; some people interpret this as channel-flooding. Best to utter a one-line problem description in a way pitched to start a conversation on the channel.

Check the documentation of the project and its homepage for the address of a project mailing list, and use it. There are several good reasons for this policy: Any question good enough to be asked of one developer will also be of value to the whole group. Contrariwise, if you suspect your question is too dumb for a mailing list, it’s not an excuse to harass individual developers. Asking questions on the list distributes load among developers. The individual developer (especially if he’s the project leader) may be too busy to answer your questions. Most mailing lists are archived and the archives are indexed by search engines. If you ask your question on-list and it is answered, a future querent could find your question and the answer on the Web instead of asking it again. If certain questions are seen to be asked often, developers can use that information to improve the documentation or the software itself to be less confusing. But if those questions are asked in private, nobody has the complete picture of what questions are asked most often. If a project has both a “user” and a “developer” (or “hacker”) mailing list or Web forum, and you are not hacking on the code, ask in the “user” list/forum. Do not assume that you will be welcome on the developer list, where they’re likely to experience your question as noise disrupting their developer traffic. However, if you are sure your question is non-trivial, and you get no answer in the “user” list/forum for several days, try the “developer” one. You would be well advised to lurk there for a few daysor at least review the last few days of archived messages, to learn the local folkways before posting (actually this is good advice on any private or semi-private list). If you cannot find a project’s mailing list address, but only see the address of the maintainer of the project, go ahead and write to the maintainer. But even in that case, don’t assume that the mailing list doesn’t exist. Mention in your e-mail that you tried and could not find the appropriate mailing list. Also mention that you don’t object to having your message forwarded to other people. (Many people believe that private e-mail should remain private, even if there is nothing secret in it. By allowing your message to be forwarded you give your correspondent a choice about how to handle your e-mail.)

Don’t waste it on babble like “Please help me” (let alone “PLEASE HELP ME!!!!”; messages with subjects like that get discarded by reflex). Don’t try to impress us with the depth of your anguish; use the space for a super-concise problem description instead. One good convention for subject headers, used by many tech support organizations, is “object - deviation”. The “object” part specifies what thing or group of things is having a problem, and the “deviation” part describes the deviation from expected behavior. Stupid: HELP! Video doesn’t work properly on my laptop! Smart: X.org 6.8.1 misshapen mouse cursor, Fooware MV1005 vid. chipset Smarter: X.org 6.8.1 mouse cursor on Fooware MV1005 vid. chipset - is misshapen The process of writing an “object-deviation” description will help you organize your thinking about the problem in more detail. What is affected? Just the mouse cursor or other graphics too? Is this specific to the X.org version of X? To version 6.8.1? Is this specific to Fooware video chipsets? To model MV1005? A hacker who sees the result can immediately understand what it is that you are having a problem with and the problem you are having, at a glance. More generally, imagine looking at the index of an archive of questions, with just the subject lines showing. Make your subject line reflect your question well enough that the next person searching the archive with a question similar to yours will be able to follow the thread to an answer rather than posting the question again. If you ask a question in a reply, be sure to change the subject line to indicate that you’re asking a question. A Subject line that looks like “Re: test” or “Re: new bug” is less likely to attract useful amounts of attention. Also, pare quotation of previous messages to the minimum consistent with cluing in new readers. Do not simply hit reply to a list message in order to start an entirely new thread. This will limit your audience. Some mail readers, like mutt, allow the user to sort by thread and then hide messages in a thread by folding the thread. Folks who do that will never see your message. Changing the subject is not sufficient. Mutt, and probably other mail readers, looks at other information in the e-mail’s headers to assign it to a thread, not the subject line. Instead start an entirely new e-mail. On Web forums the rules of good practice are slightly different, because messages are usually much more tightly bound to specific discussion threads and often invisible outside those threads. Changing the subject when asking a question in reply is not essential. Not all forums even allow separate subject lines on replies, and nearly nobody reads them when they do. However, asking a question in a reply is a dubious practice in itself, because it will only be seen by those who are watching this thread. So, unless you are sure you want to ask only the people currently active in the thread, start a new one.

Answering questions for careless and sloppy thinkers is not rewarding; we’d rather spend our time elsewhere. So expressing your question clearly and well is important. If you can’t be bothered to do that, we can’t be bothered to pay attention. Spend the extra effort to polish your language. It doesn’t have to be stiff or formal — in fact, hacker culture values informal, slangy and humorous language used with precision. But it has to be precise; there has to be some indication that you’re thinking and paying attention. Spell, punctuate, and capitalize correctly. Don’t confuse “its” with “it’s”, “loose” with “lose”, or “discrete” with “discreet”. Don’t TYPE IN ALL CAPS; this is read as shouting and considered rude. (All-smalls is only slightly less annoying, as it’s difficult to read. Alan Cox can get away with it, but you can’t.) More generally, if you write like a semi-literate boob you will very likely be ignored. So don’t use instant-messaging shortcuts. Spelling “you” as “u” makes you look like a semi-literate boob to save two entire keystrokes. Worse: writing like a l33t script kiddie hax0r is the absolute kiss of death and guarantees you will receive nothing but stony silence (or, at best, a heaping helping of scorn and sarcasm) in return. If you are asking questions in a forum that does not use your native language, you will get a limited amount of slack for spelling and grammar errors — but no extra slack at all for laziness (and yes, we can usually spot that difference). Also, unless you know what your respondent’s languages are, write in English. Busy hackers tend to simply flush questions in languages they don’t understand, and English is the working language of the Internet. By writing in English you minimize your chances that your question will be discarded unread. If you are writing in English but it is a second language for you, it is good form to alert potential respondents to potential language difficulties and options for getting around them. Examples: English is not my native language; please excuse typing errors. If you speak $LANGUAGE, please email/PM me; I may need assistance translating my question. I am familiar with the technical terms, but some slang expressions and idioms are difficult for me. I’ve posted my question in $LANGUAGE and English.

So: Send plain text mail, not HTML. (It’s not hard to turn off HTML .) MIME attachments are usually OK, but only if they are real content (such as an attached source file or patch), and not merely boilerplate generated by your mail client (such as another copy of your message). Don’t send e-mail in which entire paragraphs are single multiply-wrapped lines. (This makes it too difficult to reply to just part of the message.) Assume that your respondents will be reading mail on 80-character-wide text displays and set your line wrap accordingly, to something less than 80. However, do not wrap data (such as log file dumps or session transcripts) at any fixed column width. Data should be included as-is, so respondents can have confidence that they are seeing what you saw. Don’t send MIME Quoted-Printable encoding to an English-language forum. This encoding can be necessary when you’re posting in a language ASCII doesn’t cover, but many e-mail agents don’t support it. When they break, all those =20 glyphs scattered through the text are ugly and distracting — or may actively sabotage the semantics of your text. Never, ever expect hackers to be able to read closed proprietary document formats like Microsoft Word or Excel. Most hackers react to these about as well as you would to having a pile of steaming pig manure dumped on your doorstep. Even when they can cope, they resent having to do so. If you’re sending e-mail from a Windows machine, turn off Microsoft’s problematic “Smart Quotes” feature (From Tools \u003e AutoCorrect Options, clear the smart quotes checkbox under AutoFormat As You Type.). This is so you’ll avoid sprinkling garbage characters through your mail. In Web forums, do not abuse “smiley” and “HTML” features (when they are present). A smiley or two is usually OK, but colored fancy text tends to make people think you are lame. Seriously overusing smileys and color and fonts will make you come off like a giggly teenage girl, which is not generally a good idea unless you are more interested in sex than answers. If you’re using a graphical-user-interface mail client such as Netscape Messenger, MS Outlook, or their ilk, beware that it may violate these rules when used with its default settings. Most such clients have a menu-based “View Source” command. Use this on something in your sent-mail folder, verifying sending of plain text without unnecessary attached crud.

This applies to webpages and documentation, too; if you have found a documentation “bug”, you should supply replacement text and which pages it should go on. Remember, there are many other users that are not experiencing your problem.

Since the preceding point seems to be a tough one for many people to grasp, here’s a phrase to remind you: “All diagnosticians are from Missouri.” That US state’s official motto is “Show me” (earned in 1899, when Congressman Willard D. Vandiver said “I come from a country that raises corn and cotton and cockleburs and Democrats, and frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me. I’m from Missouri. You’ve got to show me.\") In diagnosticians' case, it’s not a matter of skepticism, but rather a literal, functional need to see whatever is as close as possible to the same raw evidence that you see, rather than your surmises and summaries. Show us. ","date":"2022-02-15","objectID":"/en/how_to_ask_questions/:4:13","tags":["提问","ask","question","Eric S.

So, your account should describe precisely what you did, and what the machine and software did, leading up to the blowup. In the case of command-line processes, having a session log (e.g., using the script utility) and quoting the relevant twenty or so lines is very useful. If the program that blew up on you has diagnostic options (such as -v for verbose), try to select options that will add useful debugging information to the transcript. Remember that more is not necessarily better; try to choose a debug level that will inform rather than drowning the reader in junk. If your account ends up being long (more than about four paragraphs), it might be useful to succinctly state the problem up top, then follow with the chronological tale. That way, hackers will know what to watch for in reading your account. ","date":"2022-02-15","objectID":"/en/how_to_ask_questions/:4:14","tags":["提问","ask","question","Eric S.

They come for help with the step, but don’t realize that the path is wrong. It can take substantial effort to get past this. Stupid: How do I get the color-picker on the FooDraw program to take a hexadecimal RGB value? Smart: I’m trying to replace the color table on an image with values of my choosing. Right now the only way I can see to do this is by editing each table slot, but I can’t get FooDraw’s color picker to take a hexadecimal RGB value. The second version of the question is smart.

Also, helpers get some of their reward for being respondents from being seen to be competent and knowledgeable by their peers. When you ask for a private reply, you are disrupting both the process and the reward. Don’t do this. It’s the respondent’s choice whether to reply privately — and if he or she does, it’s usually because he or she thinks the question is too ill-formed or obvious to be interesting to others. There is one limited exception to this rule. If you think the question is such that you are likely to get many answers that are all closely similar, then the magic words are “e-mail me and I’ll summarize the answers for the group”. It is courteous to try and save the mailing list or newsgroup a flood of substantially identical postings — but you have to keep the promise to summarize.

Those people most likely to be able to give you a useful answer are also the busiest people (if only because they take on the most work themselves). People like that are allergic to open-ended time sinks, thus they tend to be allergic to open-ended questions. You are more likely to get a useful response if you are explicit about what you want respondents to do (provide pointers, send code, check your patch, whatever). This will focus their effort and implicitly put an upper bound on the time and energy a respondent must allocate to helping you. This is good. To understand the world the experts live in, think of expertise as an abundant resource and time to respond as a scarce one. The less of a time commitment you implicitly ask for, the more likely you are to get an answer from someone really good and really busy. So it is useful to frame your question to minimize the time commitment required for an expert to field it — but this is often not the same thing as simplifying the question. Thus, for example, “Would you give me a pointer to a good explanation of X?” is usually a smarter question than “Would you explain X, please?”. If you have some malfunctioning code, it is usually smarter to ask for someone to explain what’s wrong with it than it is to ask someone to fix it.

Posting a few hundred lines of code, saying “it doesn’t work”, will get you ignored. Posting a dozen lines of code, saying “after line 7 I was expecting to see , but occurred instead” is much more likely to get you a response. The most effective way to be precise about a code problem is to provide a minimal bug-demonstrating test case. What’s a minimal test case? It’s an illustration of the problem; just enough code to exhibit the undesirable behavior and no more. How do you make a minimal test case? If you know what line or section of code is producing the problematic behavior, make a copy of it and add just enough supporting code to produce a complete example (i.e. enough that the source is acceptable to the compiler/interpreter/whatever application processes it). If you can’t narrow it down to a particular section, make a copy of the source and start removing chunks that don’t affect the problematic behavior. The smaller your minimal test case is, the better (see the section called “Volume is not precision” ). Generating a really small minimal test case will not always be possible, but trying to is good discipline. It may help you learn what you need to solve the problem on your own — and even when it doesn’t, hackers like to see that you have tried. It will make them more cooperative. If you simply want a code review, say as much up front, and be sure to mention what areas you think might particularly need review and why.

There is one semi-exception. It can be worth mentioning if you’re using the program in some high-profile place, one that the hackers will get excited about; in such a case, if you’re under time pressure, and you say so politely, people may get interested enough to answer faster. This is a very risky thing to do, however, because the hackers' metric for what is exciting probably differs from yours. Posting from the International Space Station would qualify, for example, but posting on behalf of a feel-good charitable or political cause would almost certainly not. In fact, posting “Urgent: Help me save the fuzzy baby seals!” will reliably get you shunned or flamed even by hackers who think fuzzy baby seals are important.

(If this puzzles you, remember that we value a question by what it teaches us.) However, if you’ve got your technical ducks in a row, politeness does increase your chances of getting a useful answer. (We must note that the only serious objection we’ve received from veteran hackers to this HOWTO is with respect to our previous recommendation to use “Thanks in advance”. Some hackers feel this connotes an intention not to thank anybody afterwards.

If the problem attracted general interest in a mailing list or newsgroup, it’s appropriate to post the followup there. Optimally, the reply should be to the thread started by the original question posting, and should have ‘FIXED’, ‘RESOLVED’ or an equally obvious tag in the subject line. On mailing lists with fast turnaround, a potential respondent who sees a thread about “Problem X” ending with “Problem X - FIXED” knows not to waste his/her time even reading the thread (unless (s)he personally finds Problem X interesting) and can therefore use that time solving a different problem. Your followup doesn’t have to be long and involved; a simple “Howdy — it was a failed network cable! Thanks, everyone. - Bill” would be better than nothing. In fact, a short and sweet summary is better than a long dissertation unless the solution has real technical depth. Say what action solved the problem, but you need not replay the whole troubleshooting sequence. For problems with some depth, it is appropriate to post a summary of the troubleshooting history. Describe your final problem statement. Describe what worked as a solution, and indicate avoidable blind alleys after that. The blind alleys should come after the correct solution and other summary material, rather than turning the follow-up into a detective story. Name the names of people who helped you; you’ll make friends that way. Besides being courteous and informative, this sort of followup will help others searching the archive of the mailing-list/newsgroup/forum to know exactly which solution helped you and thus may also help them. Last, and not least, this sort of followup helps everybody who assisted feel a satisfying sense of closure about the problem. If you are not a techie or hacker yourself, trust us that this feeling is very important to the gurus and experts you tapped for help. Problem narratives that trail off into unresolved nothingness are frustrating things; hackers itch to see them resolved. The goodwill that scratching that itch earns you will be very, very helpful to you next time you need to pose a question. Consider how you might be able to prevent others from having the same problem in the future. Ask yourself if a documentation or FAQ patch would help, and if the answer is yes send that patch to the maintainer. Among hackers, this sort of good followup behavior is actually more important than conventional politeness. It’s how you get a reputation for playing well with others, which can be a very valuable asset.

Rather, it’s the product of the direct, cut-through-the-bullshit communications style that is natural to people who are more concerned about solving problems than making others feel warm and fuzzy. When you perceive rudeness, try to react calmly. If someone is really acting out, it is very likely a senior person on the list or newsgroup or forum will call him or her on it. If that doesn’t happen and you lose your temper, it is likely that the person you lose it at was behaving within the hacker community’s norms and you will be considered at fault. This will hurt your chances of getting the information or help you want. On the other hand, you will occasionally run across rudeness and posturing that is quite gratuitous. The flip-side of the above is that it is acceptable form to slam real offenders quite hard, dissecting their misbehavior with a sharp verbal scalpel. Be very, very sure of your ground before you try this, however. The line between correcting an incivility and starting a pointless flamewar is thin enough that hackers themselves not infrequently blunder across it; if you are a newbie or an outsider, your chances of avoiding such a blunder are low. If you’re after information rather than entertainment, it’s better to keep your fingers off the keyboard than to risk this. (Some people assert that many hackers have a mild form of autism or Asperger’s Syndrome, and are actually missing some of the brain circuitry that lubricates “normal” human social interaction. This may or may not be true. If you are not a hacker yourself, it may help you cope with our eccentricities if you think of us as being brain-damaged. Go right ahead. We won’t care; we like being whatever it is we are, and generally have a healthy skepticism about clinical labels.) Jeff Bigler’s observations about tact filters are also relevant and worth reading.

And you’ll be told exactly how you screwed up, possibly with colourful asides. In public. When this happens, the worst thing you can do is whine about the experience, claim to have been verbally assaulted, demand apologies, scream, hold your breath, threaten lawsuits, complain to people’s employers, leave the toilet seat up, etc. Instead, here’s what you do: Get over it. It’s normal. In fact, it’s healthy and appropriate. Community standards do not maintain themselves: They’re maintained by people actively applying them, visibly, in public. Don’t whine that all criticism should have been conveyed via private e-mail: That’s not how it works. Nor is it useful to insist you’ve been personally insulted when someone comments that one of your claims was wrong, or that his views differ. Those are loser attitudes. There have been hacker forums where, out of some misguided sense of hyper-courtesy, participants are banned from posting any fault-finding with another’s posts, and told “Don’t say anything if you’re unwilling to help the user.” The resulting departure of clueful participants to elsewhere causes them to descend into meaningless babble and become useless as technical forums. Exaggeratedly “friendly” (in that fashion) or useful: Pick one. Remember: When that hacker tells you that you’ve screwed up, and (no matter how gruffly) tells you not to do it again, he’s acting out of concern for (1) you and (2) his community. It would be much easier for him to ignore you and filter you out of his life. If you can’t manage to be grateful, at least have a little dignity, don’t whine, and don’t expect to be treated like a fragile doll just because you’re a newcomer with a theatrically hypersensitive soul and delusions of entitlement. Sometimes people will attack you personally, flame without an apparent reason, etc., even if you don’t screw up (or have only screwed up in their imagination). In this case, complaining is the way to really screw up. These flamers are either lamers who don’t have a clue but believe themselves to be experts, or would-be psychologists testing whether you’ll screw up. The other readers either ignore them, or find ways to deal with them on their own. The flamers' behavior creates problems for themselves, which don’t have to concern you. Don’t let yourself be drawn into a flamewar, either. Most flames are best ignored — after you’ve checked whether they are really flames, not pointers to the ways in which you have screwed up, and not cleverly ciphered answers to your real question (this happens as well).

Ghod, doesn’t everybody know how to use Google yet? Q: How can I use X to do Y? A: If what you want is to do Y, you should ask that question without pre-supposing the use of a method that may not be appropriate. Questions of this form often indicate a person who is not merely ignorant about X, but confused about what problem Y they are solving and too fixated on the details of their particular situation. It is generally best to ignore such people until they define their problem better. Q: How can I configure my shell prompt? A: If you’re smart enough to ask this question, you’re smart enough to RTFM and find out yourself. Q: Can I convert an AcmeCorp document into a TeX file using the Bass-o-matic file converter? A: Try it and see. If you did that, you’d (a) learn the answer, and (b) stop wasting my time.

Throw out that Microsoft trash and install an open-source operating system like Linux or BSD.Note: you can ask questions related to Windows machines if they are about a program that does have an official Windows build, or interacts with Windows machines (i.e., Samba). Just don’t be surprised by the reply that the problem is with Windows and not the program, because Windows is so broken in general that this is very often the case. Q: My program doesn’t work. I think system facility X is broken. A: While it is possible that you are the first person to notice an obvious deficiency in system calls and libraries heavily used by hundreds or thousands of people, it is rather more likely that you are utterly clueless. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence; when you make a claim like this one, you must back it up with clear and exhaustive documentation of the failure case. Q: I’m having problems installing Linux or X. Can you help? A: No. I’d need hands-on access to your machine to troubleshoot this. Go ask your local Linux user group for hands-on help. (You can find a list of user groups here .)Note: questions about installing Linux may be appropriate if you’re on a forum or mailing list about a particular distribution, and the problem is with that distro; or on local user groups forums.

Smart: I used Google to try to find “Foonly Flurbamatic 2600” on the Web, but I got no useful hits. Can I get a pointer to programming information on this device? This one has already STFWed, and sounds like there might be a real problem. Stupid: I can’t get the code from project foo to compile. Why is it broken? The querent assumes that somebody else screwed up. Arrogant git… Smart: The code from project foo doesn’t compile under Nulix version 6.2. I’ve read the FAQ, but it doesn’t have anything in it about Nulix-related problems. Here’s a transcript of my compilation attempt; is it something I did? The querent has specified the environment, read the FAQ, is showing the error, and is not assuming his problems are someone else’s fault. This one might be worth some attention. Stupid: I’m having problems with my motherboard. Can anybody help? J. Random Hacker’s response to this is likely to be “Right. Do you need burping and diapering, too?” followed by a punch of the delete key. Smart: I tried X, Y, and Z on the S2464 motherboard. When that didn’t work, I tried A, B, and C. Note the curious symptom when I tried C. Obviously the florbish is grommicking, but the results aren’t what one might expect. What are the usual causes of grommicking on Athlon MP motherboards? Anybody got ideas for more tests I can run to pin down the problem? This person, on the other hand, seems worthy of an answer. He/she has exhibited problem-solving intelligence rather than passively waiting for an answer to drop from on high. In the last question, notice the subtle but important difference between demanding “Give me an answer” and “Please help me figure out what additional diagnostics I can run to achieve enlightenment.” In fact, the form of that last question is closely based on a real incident that happened in August 2001 on the linux-kernel mailing list (lkml). I (Eric) was the one asking the question that time. I was seeing mysterious lockups on a Tyan S2462 motherboard. The list members supplied the critical information I needed to solve them. By asking the question in the way I did, I gave people something to chew on; I made it easy and attractive for them to get involved. I demonstrated respect for my peers' ability and invited them to consult with me as a peer. I also demonstrated respect for the value of their time by telling them the blind alleys I had already run down. Afterwards, when I thanked everyone and remarked how well the process had worked, an lkml member observed that he thought it had worked not because I’m a “name” on that list, but because I asked the question in the proper form. Hackers are in some ways a very ruthless meritocracy; I’m certain he was right, and that if I had behaved like a sponge I would have been flamed or ignored no matter who I was. His suggestion that I write up the whole incident as instruction to others led directly to the composition of this guide.

Even if the software didn’t cost you anything, you can’t expect that support to always come for free. For popular software like Linux, there are at least 10,000 users per developer. It’s just not possible for one person to handle the support calls from over 10,000 users. Remember that even if you have to pay for support, you are still paying much less than if you had to buy the software as well (and support for closed-source software is usually more expensive and less competent than support for open-source software).

Problem-related stress can make people seem rude or stupid even when they’re not. Reply to a first offender off-line. There is no need of public humiliation for someone who may have made an honest mistake. A real newbie may not know how to search archives or where the FAQ is stored or posted. If you don’t know for sure, say so! A wrong but authoritative-sounding answer is worse than none at all. Don’t point anyone down a wrong path simply because it’s fun to sound like an expert. Be humble and honest; set a good example for both the querent and your peers. If you can’t help, don’t hinder. Don’t make jokes about procedures that could trash the user’s setup — the poor sap might interpret these as instructions. Ask probing questions to elicit more details. If you’re good at this, the querent will learn something — and so might you. Try to turn the bad question into a good one; remember we were all newbies once. While muttering RTFM is sometimes justified when replying to someone who is just a lazy slob, a pointer to documentation (even if it’s just a suggestion to google for a key phrase) is better. If you’re going to answer the question at all, give good value. Don’t suggest kludgy workarounds when somebody is using the wrong tool or approach. Suggest good tools. Reframe the question. Answer the actual question! If the querent has been so thorough as to do his or her research and has included in the query that X, Y, Z, A, B, and C have already been tried without good result, it is supremely unhelpful to respond with “Try A or B,” or with a link to something that only says, “Try X, Y, Z, A, B, or C.”. Help your community learn from the question. When you field a good question, ask yourself “How would the relevant documentation or FAQ have to change so that nobody has to answer this again?” Then send a patch to the document maintainer. If you did research to answer the question, demonstrate your skills rather than writing as though you pulled the answer out of your butt. Answering one good question is like feeding a hungry person one meal, but teaching them research skills by example is showing them how to grow food for a lifetime.

He cannot learn truths that are too complicated; he forgets truths that are too simple. —Rebecca West On June 18, 1815, one of history’s decisive battles was being fought at a Belgian village called Waterloo. On one side were 75,000 British troops under the commando the Duke of Wellington. Pitted against them were 100,000 French troops under Napoleon. Somewhere in the distance were 125,000 German soldiers marching to join the British. The battle of Waterloo is usually remembered more by military historians than investors. The tactics of the opposing sides have been rehashed and memorized late at night by cadets hoping to be generals themselves someday. The battle and its aftermath have not been hot items of attention for aspiring investors. They should be. No other episode of modern history provides so stark an illustration of the dangers and profit potential of investing under “blood in the streets” conditions. In those brief days, when the eyes of Europe turned to the scene of the fighting, ordinarily obscure relationships came into focus. Even the dullest of investors saw that the security of is holdings is ultimately connected to the way the power is exercised in the world. At stake was control over Europe for the foreseeable future. A French victory would mean a radical change in the power equation. No longer would Britain and British commercial interests be predominant. Important investments would turn, as it were, on the flip of a coin. Governments allied with Britain might default on their debts. Traders could be cut off from their markets. The British East India Company’s lucrative trade with India and the Orient could be threatened. Even the internal security of Britain itself could be endangered. Investors in London had one eye over their shoulders at recent uprisings centered in Nottinghamshire. Rioters had organized around the frightening cry, “Bread or blood.” As investors in the London market waited news of Waterloo they grew more jittery. Early reports told of French victories. The main German army, commanded by Marshal Gebhard von Bliicher, was still some way from the scene of the fighting. No one knew how far. Wellington’s position looked grim. Many among the more conservative investors sold into a weak market. Few were ready to increase their stake upon British victory. One exception was Nathan Rothschild, baron of the Austrian Empire and head of the Rothschild banking house in London. However glum the news and rumors became, Rothschild bought. Communications in 1815 were torturously slow. In those days, of course, there were no radio or TV news bulletins. Information worked its way along a cumbersome relay system until dispatches could be printed in newspapers or shouted out by criers at the corner. No investor with substantial holdings wished to be the last to hear that the battle had gone against the British and allied forces. The market was literally resting on a hair trigger. Eager together upon one another traders looked for any clue to discover when news of the battle had reached London. Knowing that they knew too little, they concluded that their best strategy lay in imitation. Like schoolchildren taking an especially difficult exam, they resolved to look over the shoulder of someone likely to get the answer right. It was well known that Nathan Rothschild had bet heavily upon a British victory. It was also known that Rothschild had invested considerable sums to develop a private intelligence system to learn about important events before they were generally known. Many people correctly assumed that Rothschild would be among the first to learn the fortunes of battle. If Rothschild bought, everyone would buy. If Rothschild sold, everyone would take it as an indication that Britain had been defeated. Nathan Rothschild was in fact the first in London to learn that the Duke of Wellington had triumphed over Napoleon.

The greatest profits can always be had by buying when prices are most depressed by pessimism. “Blood in the, streets,” however, is more than just the name for an investment principle. It is also a prediction about the world to come. As you will see, we believe that the world is now in the twilight of a major phase of economic history. The danger you face is practically as great as the threat posed to British investors at Waterloo. In a sense, it may even be more treacherous, because today’s is a hidden danger that almost no one sees or recognizes. The coming years will be a bad time to be ill advised. A time fraught with snares for anyone who is unprepared. We could be on the verge of financial upheaval when blood will, indeed, “run in the streets.” Many people will suffer staggering losses. Others, who take the right investment steps, at the right time, will earn handsome profits.

That event, now fading into history, was largely unintelligible as it occurred. No one wanted it. Almost no one predicted it. And even those who noticed symptoms of trouble— symptoms ominously similar to characteristics of today’s economy— did not draw accurate conclusions, or only gave warnings focusing on narrow aspects of the problem. One economic historian, writing in 1932, concluded: “I know of no competent student who anticipated a world depression of such cataclysmic magnitude as the years actually brought.” Even Lord Keynes, whose economic theories about the depression were later tremendously influential, was no better able than anyone else to see what events of the day meant. He mistook the collapse of the U. S stock market in October 1929 for “a bull point for world prosperity.” He could hardly have been more wrong. It turned out to be the beginning of the greatest financial crisis in history. The Great Depression still has not been adequately explained to the public. It is like an unsolved mystery, a crime for which a few politicians, like Herbert Hoover, have been hanged in the court of public opinion. But most people have no real conception of what caused the depression. It has been blamed on too much money, too little money, bootleg gin, shoeshine boys buying stocks, new tariffs, recession in the automobile industry, and the usual suspects, Wall Street bankers and the bully boys of high finance. In short, the case has been closed, but not solved. If you are like 99 percent of the investing public, you are no better prepared to recognize and cope with another upheaval like the depression than you would be had it never happened. You are literally an innocent—trusting to politicians, or your broker, or your luck to pull you through any unexpected trouble. That is like being exposed to a disease or plague that strikes without warning, and whose causes are unknown. If you can not recognize the symptoms, you can hardly protect yourself.

But why should you worry? The news is not bad. Even if economic growth has not been all it could be, it has often been worse. Here are some comments that may put the situation in perspective: “There is little pessimism.” “The basic price situation is notably sound. Commodity markets are free of speculative price inflation.” “As a nation we are living and spending far beyond our income in a manner possible only through a progressive and inflationary expansion of artificial purchasing power.” “Inflation is here.” “[There is] a considerable excess of capacity in many branches of Industry, especially in those producing basic materials or staple commodities.” “The results of a loss of our favorable balance of trade constitute the greatest single threat to American business. . . . Nor is anyone likely to deny the probability that such an excess of imports will impose onerous and possibly dangerous burdens upon those American industries which will most feel the competition.” “The condition of agriculture, the volume of unemployment, the textile trades, coal mining . . . present grave problems.” of Any further great expansion of credits not warranted under existing conditions. This position is in itself one of the greatest dangers.” “It is quite clear that the general market and speculative situation is quite out of the hands of the Federal Reserve system, just as agricultural credit and land speculation . . . escaped from control.” “America cannot remain prosperous in a world not only impoverished, but overwhelmed by debt.” we feel that we haven obligation which is paramount to avert any dangerous crisis in the money market.”* Sound familiar? These comments could have been clipped from the business and financial press yesterday. In fact, they all date from the period just before the Great Depression began in 1929. Industrial production turned down in July of that year, but almost no one suspected what was in store until the stock market crashed on October 24. Even very few understood what as happening. Widespread optimism returned, and the stock market rose sharply through the early months of 1930. Major economic upheavals are not easy to recognize. They have not been easy for people in the past. And there is no reason to think that they will be any easier to spot in the future. Unless you are prepared— and know what to look for and how to protect yourself—the coming economic upheaval could catch you as flatfooted as the last Great Depression caught your father or grandfather. But if you understand the powerful forces at work, otherwise puzzling developments will make sense. It will be like seeing color in a color-blind world. What will baffle your neighbors will be understood by you. While they make big losses, you can make big profits. That is what this book is all about— helping you prepare for the new world that is coming. THE FIVE APPROACHES TO INVESTMENT As you will see, this book develops a different approach to investment. Although the principles we explore are simple ones, they are manifested in ways that are far from obvious. In fact, for the first several chapters, this may seem more like a history book than an investment guide. As the argument develops, however, you will see that apparently distant and abstract ideas really provide the foundation for practical, moneymaking decisions. Once you understand them, we believe that you will have a large advantage over investors who don’t. You will also be in a better position to make sense of a world running mad. The novelty of our investment approach rests with the fact that we are analyzing different fundamentals from those noticed by most investors. Very few others have bothered to see and act upon the variables that we think are important. Rothschild did, with fantastic success. Other shrewd investors have as well. But you will see that the approach we explore in Blood in the Streets is the least understood and least used of the five basic approaches to","date":"2022-02-07","objectID":"/en/blood_in_the_streets/:1:3","tags":["capital","investment","资本"],"title":"Blood in the Streets","uri":"/en/blood_in_the_streets/"},{"categories":["技能","skill"],"content":"Introduction Calibre is an open source e-book management tool. Simply put, calibre allows you to organize your e-book library, convert e-books to various formats, and interact with your e-book reader, all in an intuitive and friendly manner. It is compatible with Microsoft Windows 8 onwards – as well as Apple’s macOS (and various flavors of Linux). It was created by Kovid Goyal, who still leads its development. A number of people around the world, including myself, contribute to calibre’s development. Throughout this guide and the online docs you will see ‘calibre’ instead of ‘Calibre’. That’s the convention Kovid chose, so that’s what we use. The purpose of calibre is to simplify management of your e-book library. It does this in several ways: Calibre organizes your library as a database so you can find the book you want when you want it. Calibre easily handles any size of library, and can manipulate e-book metadata – title, author, rating, etc.. Calibre converts between multiple e-book formats. Calibre supports a growing number of e-book readers, including Kindle, Kobo, Nook, and many others. Calibre is composed of three functional groups: The graphical user interface (GUI). This is the typical mode of interacting with your library. All of calibre’s principal functionality is available through the GUI. A collection of command line (CLI) utilities for advanced calibre operations. For example, the command line tools are used by the ManyBooks service to convert on an as-needed basis. Additional GUI tools such as an e-book reader and an e-book editor. These tools can be accessed via the main GUI or directly.

Run the installer; when it finishes, launch calibre. You will be greeted with a welcome wizard, that will help you initially configure calibre. The first page of the wizard allows you to choose the storage location for your e-book library. If this is your first time using calibre, the storage location should not be an existing e-book collection, but a new empty directory for calibre’s exclusive use. Calibre manages the e-books you give it in its own way. Think of the storage location as a black box. You don’t do anything with it – calibre manages the storage location for you. If you have used calibre in the past and are installing a new version, or if you have moved your library, then it’s okay to indicate a directory with an existing calibre library. Calibre is smart enough to know to use an existing library when it sees one. Click ‘next’ in the welcome wizard to be presented with an e-book reader selection. If your device is not listed, or if you intend to use more than one e-book reader, don’t panic – just use the default ‘Generic’ choice. This selection provides some conversion optimization for formats requiring fixed sizes. Click ‘next’ and then ‘finish’. Congratulations, you’ve successfully installed and configured calibre! If at any time you want to run the welcome wizard again, click the downward facing arrow to the right of the Preferences button (looks like a set of three gears) in the top tool bar, then select ‘Run welcome wizard’.

There are a few components I would like to bring to your attention. The central piece is the book list. This takes up the majority of the window and displays the books in a table. Just above the book list you will see the search area (more on this later) and above that, the tool bar. When you connect a supported e-book reader a ‘Device’ icon will appear next to the ’Library’ icon in the tool bar. You can switch between viewing books in your library and books on your e-book reader by clicking on their respective icons. The panel along the right of the window shows details about the currently selected book, including its cover. If you double click anywhere in the detail area (including on the book cover) another window will open exposing more information about the book. Clicking on any blue text in this area will perform an action specific to the information. For example, clicking the author’s name will open your web browser and search Wikipedia for information about the author. At the bottom right of the window there are four icons and the word “Jobs”. Clicking any of these icons will toggle a given view state in the GUI. From left to right: The luggage tag toggles the tag browser (on the left of the window). More on this later. The curved arrow toggles the cover flow display. Cover flow displays the book covers in a fashion similar to how a juke box lays out albums. The selected book is in the center while the neighboring covers are shown at an angle. You can navigate though the book covers with the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard. The book list will still be visible under the cover flow area. The nine squares in a grid toggles cover grid view. The cover grid replaces the book list with a grid of book covers. You might want to think of this as bookshelf view. The book toggles seeing the details panel on the right. The jobs indicator is one of the most important pieces of the GUI. This is the word ‘Jobs:’, the number next to it and the circular progress indicator. Whenever calibre is working on something (conversion, sending books to the reader, downloading news, etc.) the circular icon will spin and the number will reflect the number of jobs (activities) calibre is working on. You can click any part of the jobs indicator to show more detail about the jobs in progress.

Click the ‘Add books’ button in the tool bar at the top of the window, then select the e-books you would like calibre to import. When calibre imports your e-books it makes a copy of them in the storage location you specified during initial setup. Once you’ve added an e-book, calibre doesn’t need further access to the original file. During an e-book import, calibre tries to read the metadata from the e-book. Metadata is information about the book that is stored within the e-book itself. Different formats support different information. Often the information is incomplete or just plain wrong. Don’t worry – calibre makes it easy to fix this. Select the book whose metadata you want to change by clicking the book title in the main window. Then click ‘Edit metadata’ on the top tool bar (to the right of the ‘Add books’ button) and the metadata editor will open. The easy way to correct the metadata is to fill in the title and author, then click the ‘Download metadata’ button at the bottom, center of the Edit metadata dialog. Calibre will display possible matches for the information entered. If there is more than one result select the entry that looks like the best match. A lot of information should be filled in now. Above the ‘Download metadata’ button and to the top, right of the cover image is the ‘Download cover’ button. If the book doesn’t have a cover showing or if you don’t like the cover, click it to try to have calibre download one from the internet. Now that you have your e-books in calibre there are a few different ways to find specific e-books in your library. Direct Searching is one of the fastest ways. Above the book list there is a Search field. Think of it like having Google built into calibre. Just type a few key words into the Search field. Try the author, title, series, or anything else from the e-book’s metadata. E-books matching your search terms are shown as filtered results. The other e-books are still in your library, but they won’t be shown if the search expression doesn’t find them. You can also use the tag browser to search your library. Along the left side of the window is the tag browser. If you don’t see anything to the left of the book list, click the luggage tag icon in the lower right of the main window; a list will appear to the left of the library. It allows you to see specific subsets of your library. Clicking the icon to the left of each tag allows you to display just the e-books matching that criteria. A plus searches for all books that match and a minus searches for all books that don’t match. Notice that as you enable items in the tag browser search queries are added to the Search field. The tag browser is really just an easy way to create search queries. You could type the query directly into the Search field and see the same result.

Three of the most popular e-book readers today are the Amazon Kindle, the Kobo and the Barnes \u0026 Noble Nook. Unfortunately, not all of these devices read the same kinds of e-books. This mess is like the one in the music world where you might find such formats as WMA, MP3 and AAC. In e-books, the same confusion exists—the Tower of eBabel, as some call it. 2.1: Background If you are only buying e-books from the store associated with your reader—for example, Amazon’s Kindle Store or Kobo’s Store—you don’t need to worry about any of this. But there are very good reasons why you should know about the major formats, what formats your reader supports, and how to convert between formats. In addition to the big e-books stores, many online sites offer e-books. Everything from public domain works to novels (often offered at no charge) by well known and lesser known authors. The ‘Get books’ icon in the toolbar allows you to easily comparison shop via a store search dialog. This allows you to search many different stores (uncheck or check the stores you want it to use on the left), big and small, at once. It not only helps you find the best price but also the right format for the book you’re looking for. Please note that this feature connects you to a third party, the store, so any issues related to a purchase should be directed to the store itself because calibre is not part of this exchange. Often you can download e-books in a variety of formats, but you won’t always find them in a format your e-book reader supports. Here is where conversion comes in. There is a very good chance that you will be able to take an e-book and convert it to a format your reader supports. Realize that you can’t convert e-books that use Digital Rights Management (DRM). In the rest of the conversion section I will focus on three devices. 1) The Amazon Kindle which supports the AZW3 format. 2) The Kobo, which supports the EPUB format. 3) The Barnes \u0026 Noble Nook, which also supports the EPUB format. While both the Kobo and Nook use the EPUB format, books purchased from one store may not be readable on another device due to DRM. 2.2: Why are there different e-book formats? Advances in technology is one reason why so many different e-book formats exist. In fact, it’s a major reason. Just like the transition from VHS to DVD and now to Blu-Ray, older formats which were created to solve the problems faced at that time are replaced with newer formats that better meet the needs of today. A great example of this is the e-books people read back in the ’90s on their PDAs. Those devices were very limited in what they could display. E-book readers today are much more advanced. They can display large images and handle advanced formatting. These newer devices needed updated formats that could provide these features. E-book formats are constantly evolving. While new formats aren’t introduced very often, existing formats (like EPUB) are constantly being updated. For example, the transition from EPUB 2 to EPUB 3. One big change that comes with EPUB 3 is the ability for EPUB to support audio and video. While supporting audio and video might seem counter intuitive for an e-book, it make sense when you think about e-books as rich media. Coupled with a tablet or phone, audio and video can work very well and greatly enhance the readers experience. Another major reason for the proliferation of e-book formats is exclusivity. Many vendors like to control their own proprietary format so they are not dependent on outside companies. They also have the benefit of being able to license their format for use by others. Finally, controlling the format allows them to lock users into their platform. E-books, being relatively new, are undergoing the same growing pains that Betamax and VHS or HD-DVD and Blu-Ray went though. The EPUB format, from the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF), is an indust","date":"2022-02-04","objectID":"/en/calibre_quick_start/:4:2","tags":["Calibre","快速入门","手册","handbook"],"title":"Calibre Quick Start Guide","uri":"/en/calibre_quick_start/"},{"categories":["技能","skill"],"content":"Task 3: The e-book editor Calibre includes a tool specifically for editing e-books.

Don’t be fooled though, the editor isn’t only for simple tasks, it’s capable of handling even the most complex of layouts. In addition to including the features you’d expect from a text editor (syntax highlighting, line numbers, and regular expression based find/replace) it also supports a large number of features specific to e-books: Live preview Table of contents editor Embedded font support including subsetting Smarten punctuation Remove unused CSS Error checking Much, much more ","date":"2022-02-04","objectID":"/en/calibre_quick_start/:4:3","tags":["Calibre","快速入门","手册","handbook"],"title":"Calibre Quick Start Guide","uri":"/en/calibre_quick_start/"},{"categories":["技能","skill"],"content":"Task 4: Downloading news This feature of calibre is often overlooked. Integrated into calibre is the ability to download news from a variety of sources. As of this writing 1543 sources (‘recipes’) from all over the world, including both free and paid content, are supported. The real advantage of having calibre manage your news subscriptions is that once downloaded the content will be formatted for reading on your e-book reader. However, you can still read the news right on your computer. If you’re going to be reading the downloaded news on an e-book reader it’s best to go into ‘Preferences’, select ‘Behavior’ and set the ‘Preferred output format’ in General options to the preferred format for your e-book reader. This would be AZW3 for Kindle, and EPUB for the Kobo and Nook. Click the ‘Fetch news’ button in the top tool bar to open the news download scheduler. With so many sources the best thing to do is find the ones you like and set them to automatically download at a time convenient for you. If you don’t want to schedule automatic downloads and would rather handle it manually, you can. Just use the ‘Download now’ button that appears when you have selected a news source. In the news download scheduler you can expand the categories that are relevant to you (the ones in languages you can read) by clicking the disclosure triangles to the left of the language groupings. Look through the entries for something of interest. When you find one, select it and check the ‘Schedule for download’ check box on the right, or click ‘Download now’. You can also set how often and when you want it to download. Once downloaded the content will be converted to an e-book according to your conversion preferences. By default when you connect your e-book reader calibre will automatically transfer the downloaded news to the device. If you don’t want this to happen, and would rather transfer manually go into the ‘Preferences’, select the ‘Behavior’ category, and uncheck ‘Automatically send downloaded news to ebook reader’. Also, if you do want it send to the reader automatically it’s usually a good idea to check the ‘Delete news from library when automatically sent to reader’ option.

That’s precisely why I started collecting e-books. Calibre has full support for a wide variety of e-book readers. In total, calibre currently supports over 40 e-book readers. Yep, over 40. Everything from eInk devices like the Kindle, Kobo and Nook to cell phones and tablets. 5.1: Putting an e-book on your e-book reader Connect your e-book reader to your computer, and start calibre if it’s not already running. If your device is supported by calibre a ‘Device’ icon will appear next to the ‘Library’ button in the tool bar. Clicking the ‘Device’ icon will switch the book list from your library to a listing of e-books on your connected device. If you want to send an e-book to your device just switch back to your library, select the ‘Library’ and click ‘Send to device’ in the top tool bar. It really is that simple. Another often-used feature is removing e-books from the device by selecting a book on the device and click the ‘Remove books’ button in the top tool bar. Once you’ve finished managing the e-books stored on your device, click the down arrow next to the ‘Device’ button. You will see an eject icon (upward-pointing triangle inside a circle). Clicking the eject icon disconnects your e-book reader from the computer. Always eject your device before disconnecting it. Bad things can happen if you don’t do this. 5.2: E-book reader optional configuration There are a number of different ways you can configure calibre to interact with your device, but I’m only going to touch on the two most commonly changed options. Open up ‘Preferences’ and click ‘Sending books to devices’. Here you can customize the save template to change where e-books are saved on your device. If you have experience with music tagging programs where you can create custom save locations this should look very familiar. If you have a device like the Kindle or Kobo this isn’t very useful and can safely be left with the default settings. If you have a device, like the Cybook Gen 3, that supports folders this is extremely useful. There are a number of variables (descriptions under the template) which can be used to change where the books are saved. Lets look at a basic example, “favorites/{title} – {authors}”. {title} will be replaced with the title of the book, {authors} will be replaced with its author and the book will be put into the favorites folder. All of the replacements that can be made in the save template are listed with descriptions under template field. Another useful configuration change is disabling and reorganizing the supported formats. Let’s use the Cybook Gen 3 again as an example. In ‘Preferences’, click ‘Plugins’, then go to ‘Device Interface plugins’, select the ‘Cybook Gen 3 / Opus Device Interface’ and click ‘Customize plugin’. In the configuration for the device you will see a e-book format list. Here you can uncheck formats you don’t want sent to your e-book reader. You can also reorder the formats. The format at the top of the list (must be checked) will be the one used for automatic conversion when sending an e-book in an unsupported (or unchecked) format to the device.

All you need to do is select the e-book you want to read and click the ‘View’ button in the tool bar to have calibre open the e-book in calibre’s e-book viewer. The viewer supports everything you might expect such as bookmarks and navigation via the table of contents (if the e-book has one). The viewer, however, cannot read e-books protected with DRM.

All options have clear descriptions, and there are a lot of options. If you want to change something about calibre there may already be an option for it. It’s also a good idea to familiarize yourself with the preferences because parts of it, such as conversion, are just defaults and will be presented to you at different times for fine-tuning on a per e-book basis. The next place to look is the online user manual . Click the ‘Help’ button in the tool bar to have the user manual open in your browser. There is a wealth of information in the user manual including tips and solutions to common problems. It’s also a good idea to check the calibre FAQ for answers to common questions. Finally, there is the calibre forum on Mobileread which is the official help forum. There are a number of knowledgeable users who answer questions. Also, Kovid and myself actively participate in helping new and veteran users. If you have a question or need help this is the best place to go. If you’ve found a bug or would like to request a new feature it’s okay to ask about it on the forum but it’s also a good idea to submit it to the projects bug/issue tracking system . Forum posts tend to get lost over time while the tracking system makes it easy to see what needs fixing or worked on.

Brandeis’s series of articles on the money trust was running in Harper’s Weekly many inquiries came about publication in more accessible permanent form. Even without such urgence througbh the mail, however, it would have been clear that these articles inevitably constituted a book, since they embodied an analysis and a narrative by that mind which, on the great industrial movements of our era, is the most expert in the United States. The inquiries meant that the attentive public recognized that here was a contribution to history. Here was the clearest and most profound treatment ever published on that part of our business development which, as President Wilson and other wise men have said, has come to constitute the greatest of our problems. The story of our time is the story of industry. No scholar of the future will be able to describe our era with authority unless he comprehends that expansion and concentration which followed the harnessing of steam and electricity, the great uses of the change, and the great excesses. No historian of the future, in my opinion, will find among our contemporary documents so masterful an analysis of why concentration went astray. I am but one among many who look upon Mr. Brandeis as having ,in the gield of economics, the most inventive and sound mind of our time. While his articles were running in Harper’s Weekly I had ample opportunity to know how widespread was the belief among intelligent men that this brilliant diagnosis of our money trust was the most important contribution to current thought in many years. “Great” is one of the words that I do not use loosely, and I look upon Mr. Brandeis as a great man. In the composition of his intellect, one of the most important elements is his comprehension of figures. As one of the leading financiers of the country said to me, “Mr. Brandeis’s greatness as a lawyer is part of his greatness as a mathematician.” My views on this subject are sufficiently indicated in the follwing editorial in Harper’s Weekly. Arithmetic About five years before the Metropolitan Traction Company of New York went into the hands of receiver, Mr. Brandeis came down from Boston, and in a speech at Cooper Union prophesied that that company must fail. Leading bankers in New York and Boston were heartily recommending the stock to their customers. Mr. Braneis made his prophecy merely by analyzing the published figures. How did he win in the Pinchot-Glavis-Ballinger controversy? In various ways, no doubt; but perhaps the most critical step was when he calculated just how long it would take a fast worker to go through the Glavis-Ballinger record and make a juegment of it; whereupon he decided that Mr. Wickersham could not have made his report at the tiem it was stated to have been made, and therefore it must have been predated. Most of Mr. Brandiers’s other contributions to current history have involved arithmetic. when he succeeded in preventing a raise in freight rates, it was throught an exact analysis of cost. When he got Savings Bank Insurance started in Massachusees, it was by being abel to figure what insurance ought to cost. When he made the best contract between a city and a public utility that exists in this country, a definite grasp of the gas business was nescessary–combined, of course, with the wisdom and originality that make a statesman. He could not have invented the preferential shop if that new idea had not been founded on a precise knowledge of the conditions in the garment trades. When he established before the United States Supreme Court the constitutionality of legislation affedting women only, he relied much less upon reason than upon the amount of knowledge displayed of what actually happens to women when they are overworked–which, while not arithmetric, is built on the same intellectual quality. Nearly two years before Mr. Mellen resigned from the New Haven Railroad, Mr. Brandeis Wrote to the present Editor of this paper a private l","date":"2022-02-01","objectID":"/en/other_peoples_money/:1:0","tags":["钱","money","captital","bank","banker","invest","combine"],"title":"Other People's Money: and How the Bankers Use it","uri":"/en/other_peoples_money/"},{"categories":["capital","money"],"content":"Chapter I: Our Financial Oligarchy PRESIDENT WILSON, when Governor, declared in 1911: “The great monopoly in this country is the money monopoly. So long as that exists, our old variety and freedom and individual energy of development are out of the question. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men, who, even if their actions be honest and intended for the public interest, are necessarily concentrated upon the great undertakings in which their own money is involved and who, necessarily, by every reason of their own limitations, chill and check and destroy genuine economic freedom. This is the greatest question of all; and to this, statesmen must address themselves with an earnest determination to serve the long future and the true liberties of men.” The Pujo Committee–appointed in 1912—found: “Far more dangerous than all that has happened to us in the past in the way of elimination of competition in industry is the control of credit through the domination of these groups over our banks and industries.\"… “Whether under a different currency system the resources in our banks would be greater or less is comparatively immaterial if they continue to be controlled by a small group.\"… “It is impossible that there should be competition with all the facilities for raising money or selling large issues of bonds in the hands of these few bankers and their partners and allies, who together dominate the financial policies of most of the existing systems. . . . The acts of this inner group, as here described, have nevertheless been more destructive of competition than anything accomplished by the trusts, for they strike at the very vitals of potential competition in every industry that is under their protection, a condition which if permitted to continue, will render impossible all attempts to restore normal competitive conditions in the industrial world. . . . “If the arteries of credit now clogged well-nigh to choking by the obstructions created through the control of these groups are opened so that they may be permitted freely to play their important part in the financial system, competition in large enterprises will become possible and business can be conducted on its merits instead of being subject to the tribute and the good will of this handful of self-constituted trustees of the national prosperity.” The promise of New Freedom was joyously proclaimed in 1913. The facts which the Pujo Investigating Committee and its able Counsel, Mr. Samuel Untermyer, have laid before the country, show clearly the means by which a few men control the business of America. The report proposes measures which promise some relief. Additional remedies will be proposed. Congress will soon be called upon to act. How shall the emancipation be wrought? On what lines shall we proceed? The facts, when fully understood, will teach us. The Dominant Element The dominant element in our financial oligarchy is the investment banker. Associated banks, trust companies and life insurance companies are his tools. Controlled railroads, public service and industrial corporations are his subjects. Though properly but middlemen, these bankers bestride as masters America’s business world, so that practically no large enterprise can be undertaken successfully without their participation or approval. These bankers are, of course, able men possessed of large fortunes; but the most potent factor in their control of business is not the possession of extraordinary ability or huge wealth. The key to their power is Combination–concentration intensive and comprehensive–advancing on three distinct lines: First: There is the obvious consolidation of banks and trust companies; the less obvious affiliations–through stockholdings, voting trusts and interlocking directorates–of banking institutions which are not legally connected; and the join","date":"2022-02-01","objectID":"/en/other_peoples_money/:2:0","tags":["钱","money","captital","bank","banker","invest","combine"],"title":"Other People's Money: and How the Bankers Use it","uri":"/en/other_peoples_money/"},{"categories":["capital","money"],"content":"Chapter II: How the Combiners Combine Among the allies, two New York banks—the National City and the First National—stand preeminent. They constitute, with the Morgan firm, the inner group of the Money Trust. Each of the two banks, like J. P. Morgan \u0026 Co., has huge resources. Each of the two banks, like the firm of J. P. Morgan \u0026 Co., has been dominated by a genius in combination. In the Na­tional City it is James Stillman; in the First National, George F. Baker. Each of these gentlemen was for­merly President, and is now Chairman of the Board of Directors. The resources of the National City Bank (including its Siamese-twin security company) are about $300,000,000; those of the First National Bank (including its Siamese-twin security company) are about $200,000,000. The resources of the Morgan firm have not been disclosed. But it appears that they have available for their operations, also, huge deposits from their subjects; deposits reported as $162,500,000. The private fortunes of the chief actors in the combination have not been ascertained. But sporadic evidence indicates how great are the possibilities of accumulation when one has the use of “other people’s money.” Mr. Morgan’s wealth became proverbial. Of Mr. Stillman’s many investments, only one was specifically referred to, as he was in Europe during the investigation, and did not testify. But that one is significant. His 47,498 shares in the National City Bank are worth about $18,000,000. Mr. Jacob H. Schiff aptly described this as “a very nice investment.” Of Mr. Baker’s investments we know more, as he testified on many subjects. His 20,000 shares in the First National Bank are worth at least $20,000,000. His stocks in six other New York banks and trust companies are together worth about $3,000,000. The scale of his investment in railroads may be inferred from his former holdings in the Central Railroad of New Jersey. He was its largest stockholder—so large that with a few friends he held a majority of the $27,436,800 par value of outstanding stock, which the Reading bought at $160 a share. He is a director in 28 other railroad companies; and presumably a stock­holder in, at least, as many. The full extent of his fortune was not inquired into, for that was not an issue in the investigation. But it is not surprising that Mr. Baker saw little need of new laws. When asked: “You think everything is all right as it is in this world, do you not?” He answered, “Pretty nearly.” Ramifications of Power But wealth expressed in figures gives a wholly inadequate picture of the allies' power. Their wealth is dynamic. It is wielded by geniuses in combination. It finds its proper expression in means of control. To comprehend the power of the allies we must try to visualize the ramifications through which the forces operate. Mr. Baker is a director in 22 corporations having, with their many subsidiaries, aggregate resources or capitalization of $7,272,000,000. But the direct and visible power of the First National Bank, which Mr. Baker dominates, extends further. The Pujo report shows that its directors (including Mr. Baker’s son) are directors in at least 27 other corporations with resources of $4,270,000,000. That is, the First National is represented in 49 corporations, with aggregate resources or capitalization of $11,542,000,000. It may help to an appreciation of the allies’ power to name a few of the more prominent corporations in which, for instance, Mr. Baker’s influence is exerted—visibly and directly—as voting trustee, executive com­mittee man or simple director. \\1.

It offends laws human and divine. Applied to rival corporations, it tends to the suppression of competition and to violation of the Sherman law. Applied to corporations which deal with each other, it tends to disloyalty and to violation of the fundamental law that no man can serve two masters. In either event it tends to inefficiency; for it removes incentive and destroys soundness of judgment. It is undemocratic, for it rejects the platform: “A fair field and no favors,\"—substituting the pull of privilege for the push of manhood. It is the most potent instrument of the Money Trust. Break the control so exercised by the investment bankers over railroads, public-service and industrial corporations, over banks, life insurance and trust companies, and a long step will have been taken toward attainment of the New Freedom. The term “Interlocking directorates” is here used in a broad sense as including all intertwined conflicting interests, whatever the form, and by whatever device effected. The objection extends alike to contracts of a corporation whether with one of its directors individually, or with a firm of which he is a member, or with another corporation in which he is interested as an officer or director or stockholder. The objection extends likewise to men holding the inconsistent position of director in two potentially competing corporations, even if those corporations do not actually deal with each other. The Endless Chain A single example will illustrate the vicious circle of control—the endless chain—through which our financial oligarchy now operates: J. P. Morgan (or a partner), a director of the New York, New Haven \u0026 Hartford Railroad, causes that company to sell to J. P. Morgan \u0026 Co. an issue of bonds. J. P. Morgan \u0026 Co. borrow the money with which to pay for the bonds from the Guaranty Trust Company, of which Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. J. P. Morgan \u0026 Co. sell the bonds to the Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company, of which Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. The New Haven spends the proceeds of the bonds in purchasing steel rails from the United States Steel Corporation, of which Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. The United States Steel Corporation spends the proceeds of the rails in purchasing electrical supplies from the General Electric Company, of which Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. The General Electric sells supplies to the Western Union Telegraph Company, a subsidiary of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company; and in both Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. The Telegraph Company has an exclusive wire contract with the Reading, of which Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. The Reading buys its passenger cars from the Pullman Company, of which Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. The Pullman Company buys (for local use) locomotives from the Baldwin Locomotive Company, of which Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. The Reading, the General Electric, the Steel Corporation and the New Haven, like the Pullman, buy locomotives from the Baldwin Company. The Steel Corporation, the Telephone Company, the New Haven, the Reading, the Pullman and the Baldwin Companies, like the Western Union, buy electrical supplies from the General Electric. The Baldwin, the Pullman, the Reading, the Telephone, the Telegraph and the General Electric companies, like the New Haven, buy steel products from the Steel Corporation. Each and every one of the companies last named markets its securities through J. P. Morgan \u0026 Co.; each deposits its funds with J. P. Morgan \u0026 Co.; and with these funds of each, the firm enters upon further operations. This specific illustration is in part supposititious; but it represents truthfully the operation of interlocking directorates. Only it must be multiplied many times and with many permutations to represent fully the extent to which the intere","date":"2022-02-01","objectID":"/en/other_peoples_money/:4:0","tags":["钱","money","captital","bank","banker","invest","combine"],"title":"Other People's Money: and How the Bankers Use it","uri":"/en/other_peoples_money/"},{"categories":["capital","money"],"content":"Chapter IV: Serve One Master Only The Pujo Committee has presented the facts concerning the Money Trust so clearly that the conclusions appear inevitable. Their diagnosis discloses intense financial concentration and the means by which it is effected. Combination,—the intertwining of interests,—is shown to be the all-pervading vice of the present system. With a view to freeing industry, the Committee recommends the enactment of twenty-one specific remedial provisions. Most of these measures are wisely framed to meet some abuse disclosed by the evidence; and if all of these were adopted the Pujo legislation would undoubtedly alleviate present suffering and aid in arresting the disease. But many of the remedies proposed are “local” ones; and a cure is not possible, without treatment which is fundamental. Indeed, a major operation is necessary. This the Committee has hesitated to advise; although the fundamental treatment required is simple: “Serve one Master only.” The evils incident to interlocking directorates are, of course, fully recognized; but the prohibitions proposed in that respect are restricted to a very narrow sphere. First: The Committee recognizes that potentially competing corporations should not have a common director;—but it restricts this prohibition to directors of national banks, saying: “No officer or director of a national bank shall be an officer or director of any other bank or of any trust company or other financial or other corporation or institution, whether organized under state or federal law, that is authorized to receive money on deposit or that is engaged in the business of loaning money on collateral or in buying and selling securities except as in this section provided; and no person shall be an officer or director of any national bank who is a private banker or a member of a firm or partnership of bankers that is engaged in the business of receiving deposits: Provided, That such bank, trust company, financial institution, banker, or firm of bankers is located at or engaged in business at or in the same city, town, or village as that in which such national bank is located or engaged in business: Provided further, That a director of a national bank or a partner of such director may be an officer or director of not more than one trust company organized by the laws of the state in which such national bank is engaged in business and doing business at the same place.” Second: The Committee recognizes that a corporation should not make a contract in which one of the management has a private interest; but it restricts this prohibition (1) to national banks, and (2) to the officers, saying: “No national bank shall lend or advance money or credit or purchase or discount any promissory note, draft, bill of exchange or other evidence of debt bearing the signature or indorsement of any of its officers or of any partnership of which such officer is a member, directly or indirectly, or of any corporation in which such officer owns or has a beneficial interest of upward of ten per centum of the capital stock, or lend or advance money or credit to, for or on behalf of any such officer or of any such partnership or corporation, or purchase any security from any such officer or of or from any partnership or corporation of which such officer is a member or in which he is financially interested, as herein specified, or of any corporation of which any of its officers is an officer at the time of such transaction.” Prohibitions of intertwining relations so restricted, however supplemented by other provisions, will not end financial concentration. The Money Trust snake will, at most, be scotched, not killed. The prohibition of a common director in potentially competing corporations should apply to state banks and trust companies, as well as to national banks; and it should apply to railroad and industrial corporations as fully as to banking institutions.

Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman. And publicity has already played an important part in the struggle against the Money Trust. The Pujo Committee has, in the disclosure of the facts concerning financial concentration, made a most important contribution toward attainment of the New Freedom. The battlefield has been surveyed and charted. The hostile forces have been located, counted and appraised. That was a necessary first step—and a long one—towards relief. The provisions in the Committee’s bill concerning the incorporation of stock exchanges and the statement to be made in connection with the listing of securities would doubtless have a beneficent effect. But there should be a further call upon publicity for service. That potent force must, in the impending struggle, be utilized in many ways as a continuous remedial measure. Wealth Combination and control of other people’s money and of other people’s businesses. These are the main factors in the development of the Money Trust. But the wealth of the investment banker is also a factor. And with the extraordinary growth of his wealth in recent years, the relative importance of wealth as a factor in financial concentration has grown steadily. It was wealth which enabled Mr. Morgan, in 1910, to pay $3,000,000 for $51,000 par value of the stock of the Equitable Life Insurance Society. His direct income from this investment was limited by law to less than one-eighth of one per cent. a year; but it gave legal control of $504,000,000 of assets. It was wealth which enabled the Morgan associates to buy, from the Equitable and the Mutual Life Insurance Company the stocks in the several banking institutions, which, merged in the Bankers' Trust Company and the Guaranty Trust Company, gave them control of $357,000,000 deposits. It was wealth which enabled Mr. Morgan to acquire his shares in the First National and National City banks, worth $21,000,000, through which he cemented the triple alliance with those institutions. Now, how has this great wealth been accumulated? Some of it was natural accretion. Some of it is due to special opportunities for investment wisely availed of. Some of it is due to the vast extent of the bankers' operations. Then power breeds wealth as wealth breeds power. But a main cause of these large fortunes is the huge tolls taken by those who control the avenues to capital and to investors. There has been exacted as toll literally “all that the traffic will bear.” Excessive Bankers’ Commissions The Pujo Committee was unfortunately prevented by lack of time from presenting to the country the evidence covering the amounts taken by the investment bankers as promoters' fees, underwriting commissions and profits. Nothing could have demonstrated so clearly the power exercised by the bankers, as a schedule showing the aggregate of these taxes levied within recent years. It would be well worth while now to reopen the Money Trust investigation merely to collect these data. But earlier investigations have disclosed some illuminating, though sporadic facts. The syndicate which promoted the Steel Trust, took, as compensation for a few weeks' work, securities yielding $62,500,000 in cash; and of this, J. P. Morgan \u0026 Co. received for their services, as Syndicate Managers, $12,500,000, besides their share, as syndicate subscribers, in the remaining $50,000,000. The Morgan syndicate took for promoting the Tube Trust $20,000,000 common stock out of a total issue of $80,000,000 stock (preferred and common). Nor were monster commissions limited to trust promotions. More recently, bankers' syndicates have, in many instances, received for floating preferred stocks of recapitalized industrial concerns, one-third of all common stock issued, besides a considerable sum in cash. And for the sale of preferred stock of well e","date":"2022-02-01","objectID":"/en/other_peoples_money/:6:0","tags":["钱","money","captital","bank","banker","invest","combine"],"title":"Other People's Money: and How the Bankers Use it","uri":"/en/other_peoples_money/"},{"categories":["capital","money"],"content":"Chapter VI: Where the Banker is Superfluous The abolition of interlocking directorates will greatly curtail the bankers' power by putting an end to many improper combinations. Publicity concerning bankers' commissions, profits and associates, will lend effective aid, particularly by curbing undue exactions. Many of the specific measures recommended by the Pujo Committee (some of them dealing with technical details) will go far toward correcting corporate and banking abuses; and thus tend to arrest financial concentration. But the investment banker has, within his legitimate province, acquired control so extensive as to menace the public welfare even where his business is properly conducted. If the New Freedom is to be attained, every proper means of lessening that power must be availed of. A simple and effective remedy, which can be widely applied, even without new legislation, lies near at hand: Eliminate the banker-middleman where he is superfluous. Today practically all governments, states and municipalities pay toll to the banker on all bonds sold. Why should they? It is not because the banker is always needed. It is because the banker controls the only avenue through which the investor in bonds and stocks can ordinarily be reached. The banker has become the universal tax gatherer. True, thepro rataof taxes levied by him upon our state and city governments is less than that levied by him upon the corporations. But few states or cities escape payment of some such tax to the banker on every loan it makes. Even where the new issues of bonds are sold at public auction, or to the highest bidder on sealed proposals, the bankers' syndicates usually secure large blocks of the bonds which are sold to the people at a considerable profit. The middleman, even though unnecessary, collects his tribute. There is a legitimate field for dealers in state and municipal bonds, as for other merchants. Investors already owning such bonds must have a medium through which they can sell their holdings. And those states or municipalities which lack an established reputation among investors, or which must seek more distant markets, need the banker to distribute new issues. But there are many states and cities which have an established reputation and have a home market at hand. These should sell their bonds direct to investors without the intervention of a middleman. And as like conditions prevail with some corporations, their bonds and stocks should also be sold direct to the investor. Both financial efficiency and industrial liberty demand that the bankers' toll be abolished, where that is possible. Banker and Broker The business of the investment banker must not be confused with that of the bond and stock broker. The two are often combined; but the functions are essentially different. The broker performs a very limited service. He has properly nothing to do with the original issue of securities, nor with their introduction into the market. He merely negotiates a purchase or sale as agent for another under specific orders. He exercises no discretion, except in the method of bringing buyer and seller together, or of executing orders. For his humble service he receives a moderate compensation, a commission, usually one-eighth of one per cent. (12 ½ cents for each $100) on the par value of the security sold. The investment banker also is a mere middleman. But he is a principal, not an agent. He is also a merchant in bonds and stocks. The compensation received for his part in the transaction is in many cases more accurately described as profit than as commission. So far as concerns new issues of government, state and municipal bonds, especially, he acts as merchant, buying and selling securities on his own behalf; buying commonly at wholesale from the maker and selling at retail to the investors; taking the merchant’s risk and the merchant’s profits.

Morgan \u0026 Co. declare, in their letter to the Pujo Committee, that “practically all the railroad and industrial development of this country has taken place initially through the medium of the great banking houses.” That statement is entirely unfounded in fact. On the contrary nearly every such contribution to our comfort and prosperity was “initiated\"withouttheir aid. The “great banking houses” came into relation with these enterprises, either after success had been attained, or upon “reorganization” after the possibility of success had been demonstrated, but the funds of the hardy pioneers, who had risked their all, were exhausted. This is true of our early railroads, of our early street railways, and of the automobile; of the telegraph, the telephone and the wireless; of gas and oil; of harvesting machinery, and of our steel industry; of textile, paper and shoe industries; and of nearly every other important branch of manufacture. Theinitiationof each of these enterprises may properly be characterized as “great transactions”; and the men who contributed the financial aid and business management necessary for their introduction are entitled to share, equally with inventors, in our gratitude for what has been accomplished. But the instances are extremely rare where the original financing of such enterprises was undertaken by investment bankers, great or small. It was usually done by some common business man, accustomed to taking risks; or by some well-to-do friend of the inventor or pioneer, who was influenced largely by considerations other than money-getting. Here and there you will find that banker-aid was given; but usually in those cases it was a small local banking concern, not a “great banking house”' which helped to “initiate” the undertaking. Railroads We have come to associate the great bankers with railroads. But their part was not conspicuous in the early history of the Eastern railroads; and in the Middle West the experience was, to some extent, similar. The Boston \u0026 Maine Railroad owns and leases 2,215 miles of line; but it is a composite of about 166 separate railroad companies. The New Haven Railroad owns and leases 1,996 miles of line; but it is a composite of 112 separate railroad companies. The necessary capital to build these little roads was gathered together, partly through state, county or municipal aid; partly from business men or landholders who sought to advance their special interests; partly from investors; and partly from well-to-do public-spirited men, who wished to promote the welfare of their particular communities. About seventy-five years after the first of these railroads was built, J. P. Morgan \u0026 Co. became fiscal agent for all of them by creating the New Haven-Boston \u0026 Maine monopoly. Steamships The history of our steamship lines is similar. In 1807, Robert Fulton, with the financial aid of Robert R. Livingston, a judge and statesman—not a banker— demonstrated with the Claremont, that it was practicable to propel boats by steam. In 1833 the three Cunard brothers of Halifax and 232 other persons—stockholders of the Quebec and Halifax Steam Navigation Company—joined in supplying about $80,000 to build the Royal William, the first steamer to cross the Atlantic. In 1902, many years after individual enterprises had developed practically all the great ocean lines, J. P. Morgan \u0026 Co. floated the International Mercantile Marine with its $52,744,000 of 4 1/2 bonds, now selling at about 60, and $100,000,000 of stock (preferred and common) on which no dividend has ever been paid. It was just sixty-two years after the first regular line of transatlantic steamers—the Cunard—was founded that Mr. Morgan organized the Shipping Trust. Telegraph The story of the telegraph is similar. The money for developing Morse’s invention was supplied by his partner and co-worker, Alfred Vail. The initial line (from Washington to Baltimore) was built with an appropriation of ","date":"2022-02-01","objectID":"/en/other_peoples_money/:8:0","tags":["钱","money","captital","bank","banker","invest","combine"],"title":"Other People's Money: and How the Bankers Use it","uri":"/en/other_peoples_money/"},{"categories":["capital","money"],"content":"Chapter VIII: A Curse of Bigness Bigness has been an important factor in the rise of the Money Trust: Big railroad systems, Big industrial trusts, big public service companies; and as instruments of these Big banks and Big trust companies. J. P. Morgan \u0026 Co. (in their letter of defence to the Pujo Committee) urge the needs of Big Business as the justification for financial concentration. They declare that what they euphemistically call “cooperation” is “simply a further result of the necessity for handling great transactions”; that “the country obviously requires not only the larger individual banks, but demands also that those banks shall cooperate to perform efficiently the country’s business”; and that “a step backward along this line would mean a halt in industrial progress that would affect every wage-earner from the Atlantic to the Pacific.” The phrase “great transactions” is used by the bankers apparently as meaning large corporate security issues. Leading bankers have undoubtedly cooperated during the last 15 years in floating some very large security issues, as well as many small ones. But relatively few large issues were made necessary by great improvements undertaken or by industrial development. Improvements and development ordinarily proceed slowly. For them, even where the enterprise involves large expenditures, a series of smaller issues is usually more appropriate than single large ones. This is particularly true in the East where the building of new railroads has practically ceased. The “great” security issues in which bankers have cooperated were, with relatively few exceptions, made either for the purpose of effecting combinations or, as a consequence of such combinations. Furthermore, the combinations which made necessary these large security issues or underwritings were, in most cases, either contrary to existing statute law, or contrary to laws recommended by the Interstate Commerce Commission, or contrary to the laws of business efficiency. So both the financial concentration and the combinations which they have served were, in the main, against the public interest. Size, we are told, is not a crime. But size may, at least, become noxious by reason of the means through which it was attained or the uses to which it is put. And it is size attained by combination, instead of natural growth, which has contributed so largely to our financial concentration. Let us examine a few cases: The Harriman Pacifics J. P. Morgan \u0026 Co., in urging the “need of large banks and the cooperation of bankers,” said: “The Attorney-General’s recent approval of the Union Pacific settlement calls for a single commitment on the part of bankers of $126,000,000.” This $126,000,000 “commitment” was not made to enable the Union Pacific to secure capital. On the contrary it was a guaranty that it would succeed in disposing of its Southern Pacific stock to that amount. And when it had disposed of that stock, it was confronted with the serious problem—what to do with the proceeds? This huge underwriting became necessary solely because the Union Pacific had violated the Sherman Law. It had acquired that amount of Southern Pacific stock illegally; and the Supreme Court of the United States finally decreed that the illegality cease. This same illegal purchase had been the occasion, twelve years earlier, of another “great transaction,\"—the issue, of a $100,000,000 of Union Pacific bonds, which were sold to provide funds for acquiring this Southern Pacific and other stocks in violation of law. Bankers “cooperated” also to accomplish that. Union Pacific Improvements The Union Pacific and its auxiliary lines (the Oregon Short Line, the Oregon Railway and Navigation and the Oregon-Washington Railroad) made, in the fourteen years, ending June 30, 1912, issues of securities aggregating $375,158,183 (of which $46,500,000 were refunded or redeemed) ; but the large security issues served mainly to supply funds for engaging in illegal combinations or st","date":"2022-02-01","objectID":"/en/other_peoples_money/:9:0","tags":["钱","money","captital","bank","banker","invest","combine"],"title":"Other People's Money: and How the Bankers Use it","uri":"/en/other_peoples_money/"},{"categories":["capital","money"],"content":"Chapter IX: The Failure of Banker-Management Thereis not one moral, but many, to be drawn from the Decline of the New Haven and the Fall of Mellen. That history offers texts for many sermons. It illustrates the Evils of Monopoly, the Curse of Bigness, the Futility of Lying, and the Pitfalls of Law-Breaking. But perhaps the most impressive lesson that it should teach to investors is the failure of banker-management. Banker Control For years J. P. Morgan \u0026 Co. were the fiscal agents of the New Haven. For years Mr. Morgan wasthedirector of the Company. He gave to that property probably closer personal attention than to any other of his many interests. Stockholders’ meetings are rarely interesting or important; and few indeed must have been the occasions when Mr. Morgan attended any stockholders' meeting of other companies in which he was a director. But it was his habit, when in America, to be present at meetings of the New Haven. In 1907, when the policy of monopolistic expansion was first challenged, and again at the meeting in 1909 (after Massachusetts had unwisely accorded its sanction to the Boston \u0026 Maine merger), Mr. Morgan himself moved the large increases of stock which were unanimously voted. Of course, he attended the important directors' meeting. His will was law. President Mellen indicated this in his statement before Interstate Commerce Commissioner Prouty, while discussing the New York, Westchester \u0026 Boston—the railroad without a terminal in New York, which cost the New Haven $1,500,000 a mile to acquire, and was then costing it, in operating deficits and interest charges, $100,000 a month to run: “I am in a very embarrassing position, Mr. Commissioner, regarding the New York, Westchester \u0026 Boston. I have never been enthusiastic or at all optimistic of its being a good investment for our company in the present, or in the immediate future; but people in whom I had greater confidence than I have in myself thought it was wise and desirable; I yielded my judgment; indeed, I don’t know that it would have made much difference whether I yielded or not.” The Banker’s Responsibility Bankers are credited with being a conservative force in the community. The tradition lingers that they are preeminently “safe and sane.” And yet, the most grievous fault of this banker-managed railroad has been its financial recklessness—a fault that has already brought heavy losses to many thousands of small investors throughout New England for whom bankers are supposed to be natural guardians. In a community where its railroad stocks have for generations been deemed absolutely safe investments, the passing of the New Haven and of the Boston \u0026 Maine dividends after an unbroken dividend record of generations comes as a disaster. This disaster is due mainly to enterprises outside the legitimate operation of these railroads; for no railroad company has equaled the New Haven in the quantity and extravagance of its outside enterprises. But it must be remembered, that neither the president of the New Haven nor any other railroad manager could engage in such transactions without the sanction of the Board of Directors. It is the directors, not Mr. Mellen, who should bear the responsibility. Close scrutiny of the transactions discloses no justification. On the contrary, scrutiny serves only to make more clear the gravity of the errors committed. Not merely were recklessly extravagant acquisitions made in mad pursuit of monopoly; but the financial judgment, the financiering itself, was conspicuously bad. To pay for property several times what it is worth, to engage in grossly unwise enterprises, are errors of which no conservative directors should be found guilty; for perhaps the most important function of directors is to test the conclusions and curb by calm counsel the excessive zeal of too ambitious managers. But while we have no right to expect from bankers exceptionally good judgment in ordinary business matters; we do have a right to expect from th","date":"2022-02-01","objectID":"/en/other_peoples_money/:10:0","tags":["钱","money","captital","bank","banker","invest","combine"],"title":"Other People's Money: and How the Bankers Use it","uri":"/en/other_peoples_money/"},{"categories":["capital","money"],"content":"Chapter X: The Inefficiency of the Oligarchs We must break the Money Trust or the Money Trust will break us. The Interstate Commerce Commission said in its report on the most disastrous of the recent wrecks on the New Haven Railroad: “On this directorate were and are men whom the confiding public recognize as magicians in the art of finance, and wizards in the construction, operation, and consolidation of great systems of railroads. The public therefore rested secure that with the knowledge of the railroad art possessed by such men investments and travel should both be safe. Experience has shown that this reliance of the public was not justified as to either finance or safety.” This failure of banker-management is not surprising. The surprise is that men should have supposed it would succeed. For banker-management contravenes the fundamental laws of human limitations: First, that no man can serve two masters; second, that a man cannot at the same time do many things well. Seeming Successes There are numerous seeming exceptions to these rules; and a relatively few real ones. Of course, many banker-managed properties have been prosperous; some for a long time, at the expense of the public; some for a shorter time, because of the impetus attained before they were banker-managed. It is not difficult to have a large net income, where one has the field to oneself, has all the advantage privilege can give, and may “charge all the traffic will bear.” And even in competitive business the success of a long-established, well-organized business with a widely extended good-will, must continue for a considerable time; especially if buttressed by intertwined relations constantly giving it the preference over competitors. The real test of efficiency comes when success has to be struggled for; when natural or legal conditions limit the charges which may be made for the goods sold or service rendered. Our banker-managed railroads have recently been subjected to such a test, and they have failed to pass it. “It is only,\"' says Goethe, “when working within limitations, that the master is disclosed.” Why Oligarchy Fails Banker-management fails, partly because the private interest destroys soundness of judgment and undermines loyalty. It fails partly, also, because banker directors are led by their occupation (and often even by the mere fact of their location remote from the operated properties) to apply a false test in making their decisions. Prominent in the banker-director mind is always this thought: “What will be the probable effect of our action upon the market value of the company’s stock and bonds, or, indeed, generally upon stock exchange values?” The stock market is so much a part of the investment-banker’s life, that he cannot help being affected by this consideration, however disinterested he may be. The stock market is sensitive. Facts are often misinterpreted “by the street'” or by investors. And with the best of intentions, directors susceptible to such influences are led to unwise decisions in the effort to prevent misinterpretations. Thus, expenditures necessary for maintenance, or for the ultimate good of a property are often deferred by banker-directors, because of the belief that the making of themnow, would (by showing smaller net earnings), create a bad, and even false, impression on the market. Dividends are paid which should not be, because of the effect which it is believed reduction or suspension would have upon the market value of the company’s securities. To exercise a sound judgment in the difficult affairs of business is, at best, a delicate operation. And no man can successfully perform that function whose mind is diverted, however innocently, from the study of, “what is best in the long run for the company of which I am director?” The banker-director is peculiarly liable to such distortion of judgment by reason of his occupation and his environment.
